    "description": "This style will remove the sidebar on Curse's Dota 2 Wiki which was added on September 27th, 2012 and many other annoying features.\r\nThe goal of this is to accomplish a style for the wiki that is not influenced by Curse's profit decisions, it will turn the Dota 2 Wiki into a beautiful page which is clear and simple for browsing.\r\n\r\nThese are the full list of features that are removed upon installing this style:\r\n- Top advertisement\r\n- contentSub on the main page (it causes a small gap that makes the language box look odd, this is something the wiki admins should have fixed themselves to begin with)\r\n- Bottom advertisement\r\n- Curse sidebar on any page except main page (as there is none on it)\r\n- Curse's self-advertisement of their other sites.",
