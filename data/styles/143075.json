    "description": "Since the ability to react to comments was introduced on Facebook, I keep finding myself accidentally unliking comments because I thought I hadn't liked them yet. This is because the only thing that changes when you like something is the weight of the font. This little userstyle fixes that by also underlining the \"like\" text.",
