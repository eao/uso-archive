    "description": "This is so lame that I wasn't sure it was worth uploading, but what the heck. \r\n\r\nI have a pretty sidebar toolbar, but this darned TACO icon (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/targeted-advertising-cookie-op/) is huge and ruins it. This is a tiny hack to make it normal sized.\r\n\r\nPlease note, this is only if you have set your icons to \"Use Small Icons\". If you are using big icons, don't bother with this mod unless you want just the TACO icon to be small.",
