    "description": "Returns the banners to FIMFiction.net after knighty removed them recently, to replace then with an unnecessary author tab.\r\nWe all care about an aesthetic look of FIMFiction.net and with this tool, you can return the beautiful banners you love.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis userstyle was not made by me, it was created by PiercingSight: http://www.fimfiction.net/user/PiercingSight\r\n\r\nUpdate to adapt to knighty's so-called \"FIMFiction 4.0\" was made possible by alamais, whose own userscript helped me to find out what I need to change:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fimfiction.net/user/85763/alamais",
