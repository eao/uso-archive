    "description": "Color all Listener names at thesixtyone.com black.\r\n\r\nIt's a small set of working style rules, but you should consider it as a kind of statement. Ever since listener name coloring was introduced to show how much money people spend on artists, I feel uncomfortable listening to music for free. I don't credit artists or buy their mp3 albums for my own valid reasons, yet I agree that most artists deserve some earnings. If only they could make a clear choice between playing for money or playing for free. I hate peer pressure as a marketing scheme.",
