    "name": "Steemit - Increase Visibility of DownVoted Posts",
    "description": "When posts have been significantly downvoted they are made semi visible in the lists of posts. Since posts are sometimes downvoted maliciously it is possible that such posts will be unfairly overlooked due to their reduced visibility. This style makes these posts more visible, instead of less visible - meaning that users are prompted to explore and decide for themselves whether they agree with the downvote, instead of just skipping over the post as if it has already been found guilty of violations of the fully agreed upon anarcho capitalist rules! ;)",
