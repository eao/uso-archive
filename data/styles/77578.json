    "description": "Removes the competitive header from the top of /r/tf2.\r\nRemoves the \"bonus ducks\" from usernames.\r\nRemoves all sticky posts due to moderator stupidity. TL;DR: nothing of any use has ever been said in the stickied posts.\r\n\r\nLonger version: The moderators of /r/tf2 seem to have a very narrow view of what /r/tf2 should be which means banning everything they dislike, no matter how minor, and seem to enjoy announcing rule changes as sticky posts on a daily basis. They also seem to enjoy stickying posts related to their personal interests, overriding the community choice to ignore or downvote stuff that we don't find interesting.",
