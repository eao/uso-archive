    "description": "Features:\r\n\r\n\"URL preview compatability\" -\r\nThe URL preview bar that shows and hides depending on if your cursor is hovering over a link in Firefox and Chrome usually covers the 4chan X Image Hover. This places a 20 px space where the image can't go so that it can never be covered by it.\r\n\"Keep on top\" -\r\nChanges the z-index of the 4chan X Image hover so that elements in other userstyles like navigation bars and quick reply windows don't cover it up.\r\n\"Fit to screen width and height\" -\r\nKeeps images from 4chan X Image Hover limited to the size of your screen so that larges images don't go off the screen.",
