    "description": "Before KoL rejiggered the store interface, adding native support for viewing the lowest 5 prices instead of only the lowest one, there was a greasemonkey script to do that for you. I love that they added that functionality natively, but I <i>didn't</i> like that the result of the lookup was displayed like this:\r\nunlimited: 1,175 x501 1,195 x157 1,195 x154 1,200 x175\r\n\r\nTo me, that felt significantly more of a pain to scan through, especially if you have a lot of items in your store, than the more vertical layout of the greasemonkey script. Thus, this script inserts line breaks between price items in your inventory management, which in my opinion makes the page much more readable.",
