One problem is that site userstyles.org supports just styles that have no more than 65536 characters. Naturally, combination of four long styles exceeds this limit so it couldn't be uploaded here. If you want to use this style, you can copy&paste it from my site http://peepay.googlepages.com/complete_new_google_look.txt\r\n\r\nDon't click the \"Load into Stylish\" button!!! I couldn't leave the \"code\" field empty and had to write something there but it is NOT the \"Complete new Google look\" style!",
