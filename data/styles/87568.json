    "description": "Disables the Twitch.tv chat and applies full width in place of the chatbox.\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nYou may want to prevent yourself from spoilers concerning tv-shows and movies, also prevents you from seeing overall stupidity and anonimity around that place.\r\n\r\nWhy it's useful:\r\nEverytime you enter a twitch channel you're welcomed by the chat box, and then you have to click on it's settings and disable it. Remember that even before you click fullscreen-mode you might have already been spoiler'ed or struck by the stupidity.",
