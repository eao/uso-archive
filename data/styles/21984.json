    "description": "Discogs updated it's layout, so far so good.\r\nThey had the terrible idea to put in a fixed-width of about 1000 pixels.\r\nAfter many complaints, they changed it to a max-width of 1200 pixels.\r\n\r\nVery nice, most people don't notice the max-width. But the moment you use a larger screen at a resolution of 1600 to 1920 pixels width, it looks like you're pinched between two walls...\r\n\r\nExtra width is very usefull on discogs, as you're sometimes looking at a lot of data.\r\nSo here is a small code that disables the max-width:",
