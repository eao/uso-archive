    "description": "Removes the SUPER ANNOYING Floating Header Bar, with its Horizontal Progress-Strip (that displays the article page vertical-scroll position, and follows you down the page), from Mail.com NEWS-related articles ONLY. The standard, non-floating Header Bar is NOT removed on Mail.com's home page, login, logout, or any other NON-NEWS pages. News topic categories (such as \"SciTech\", \"Business\", \"Entertainment\", etc) are added to this User Style's \"@-moz-document url-prefix\" section when new URL patterns are encountered. Also, removes the blocks of ads and junk in the right column. See the 2nd screenshot (with User Style disabled) linked under the main screenshot, which shows elements removed. I recommend also using \"Mail.com - Project:ABE\" for Mail.com generally (see the <b>NOTES</b> section).",
