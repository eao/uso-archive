    "description": "This theme is to help those who need the font much larger for readability. Unfortunately the larger size font will come at the cost of some layout issues but being able to read is much more important than the visuals of the site\r\n\r\nThis theme can be used with the following Extensions: Stylish and Stylus(recommended) for Chrome, Firefox, and Kiwi Browser(Android) and Cascadea for Safari on Mac only. Install your extension first and then come to this page to use the Install Style button. You can come back here to also update your style when I push an update.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions please reach out to EWM on Ravelry via the following project page.\r\nhttps://www.ravelry.com/projects/EWM/ravelry-stylish-updatecheck-project-page-for-updates\r\n\r\nIf you would like to donate to show support I have a Ko-fi page here https://ko-fi.com/evanitawmontalvo",
