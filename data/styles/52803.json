    "description": "Removes some of the crap that tell what features are premium membership features and what aren't. I just went in to try and upgrade this style and found a million more premium membership ads. I'm actually not sure how to handle it because dA displays the feature fully then advertises the premium membership upgrade. I can't really do anything about it without either hiding the button (which would be confusing because there'd be not indication of why a feature isn't working), or completely hiding the feature but this would break the style for actual Premium Members.\r\n\r\nWhy people use this site in general is extremely confusing to me. There are sites out there that don't feel the need to endlessly advertise stupid meaningless features in exchange for a fairly substantial amount of money. Try Weasyl or something similar.",
