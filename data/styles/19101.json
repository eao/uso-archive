    "description": "This script allows you to change the visited link color across the Metafilter sites. It was so close to white that after I clicked on a link in a long narrative (especially on AskMe) I had a hard time finding it again. Note: Plutor, of Mefi Greasemonkey script writing fame, wrote this for me. Thanks Plutor!\r\n\r\nBy default the visited link color is changed to a light brown. Edit the script in Stylish and change the HTML code to anything you like.",
