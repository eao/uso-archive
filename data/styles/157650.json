    "description": "Tired of looking for images on Pinterest and not being able to see them at all? Tired of scrolling only to get the login box pop up and restricting you from the rest of the wonderful images?\r\nFear no more. \r\nIf you have used a search engine to find images and got a Pinterest image search link now you wont get the pop and you can scroll as long as you like.\r\nEven better, when you click on a particular image you can now get the site they came from too, without having to login/create an account.",
