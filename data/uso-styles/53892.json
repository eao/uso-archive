Since I have more than 1,000 friends, I noticed that it's a quite busy area, and I don't want it feeding and scrolling all the time. I prefer having a bit of control to read and scroll as I like, just using the main area of the site. So I just removed that new box completely. It's the simplest css script I have ever written in my whole life. Enjoy.","user":{"id":57584,"name":"lu_","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"luiscarlosrubino@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2011-09-21T12:01:16.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":647,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/53892-after.png?r=1588147495","url":"/styles/53892/facebook-no-scroll-feed","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"facebook.com\") {\r\n\r\n#pagelet_rhc_ticker {\r\ndisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}
