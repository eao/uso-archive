If you're not a member, they still give you the answers, but they make you scroll way down to the bottom of the page first.  This script removes *all* that crap and reduces the page to the bare minimum necessary, just the question and the answers.  It's not overly pretty, but I find beauty in minimalism.  What matters to me here is the content.","user":{"id":8325,"name":"Xanthir","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-05-02T16:20:19.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":462,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/6873-after.png?r=1589184326","url":"/styles/6873/experts-exchange-nothing-but-answers","discussionsCount":4,"commentsCount":4,"css":"@-moz-document domain(www.experts-exchange.com) {\r\n\r\n.squareSignUp, .squareSignUpWide, #relatedSolutions20X6, .lightImage, .light20, .freePAQ, .blurredAnswer, .sectionFour, .qStats, #pageRight, table.h, .infoCol, .ontopBanner, #pageHeader, #breadCrumb, #pageFooter, .qTagRow, .questionScore, .qZoneRow\r\n{ display: none !important; }\r\n\r\n* { width: auto !important; max-width: none !important; background: none !important; }\r\n\r\n.infoBody { margin-left: 0 !important; background: #eee !important; }\r\n\r\n}"}
