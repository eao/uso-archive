This style will be updated every time I find something. \r\n\r\n(Works great with: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/9081-gaiaupgrade, https://userstyles.org/styles/104393/gaia-online-tonedpmp-de-cashify-de-crapify)","user":{"id":310682,"name":"SenpaiMint","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":"Welcome!","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2016-06-12T02:01:44.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":177,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/127650_after.png?r=1590048392","url":"/styles/127650/degary-gaia-online","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":3,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.gaiaonline.com\") { #announcement, #bd-sub, #runway_menu, #yui-gen17, header_content, #c7, #c26, #related_items, #offer_banner, #gcash_menu, #tiespend_header  {display: none;} \r\n\r\n}"}
