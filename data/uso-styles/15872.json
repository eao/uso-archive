I centered the link anchors inside instead of blocking them per line and added a .25em margin around the donation image. The splash area and intro paragraph are expanded to full width to fill the gap.","user":{"id":20949,"name":"tilt","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-03-12T19:36:05.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":92,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/15872-after.png?r=1588925024","url":"/styles/15872/fix-gimp-org-site-nav-with-noscript","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"gimp.org\") {\r\n   #menu {\r\n     margin: 0 !important;\r\n     padding: 0 !important;\r\n     float: none !important;\r\n     width: 100% !important;\r\n     text-align: center !important;\r\n   }\r\n   #menu > a {\r\n      display: inline !important;\r\n      margin: 1px !important;\r\n   }\r\n   #menu > a > img {\r\n      margin: 0.25em !important;\r\n   }\r\n   #main > div.splash {\r\n      right: 0px !important;\r\n   }\r\n  #main > p.intropara {\r\n      right: 0px !important;\r\n   }\r\n}"}
