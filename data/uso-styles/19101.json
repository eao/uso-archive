It was so close to white that after I clicked on a link in a long narrative (especially on AskMe) I had a hard time finding it again. Note: Plutor, of Mefi Greasemonkey script writing fame, wrote this for me. Thanks Plutor!\r\n\r\nBy default the visited link color is changed to a light brown. Edit the script in Stylish and change the HTML code to anything you like.","user":{"id":11119,"name":"KatGamer","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-11-01T20:09:38.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":377,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/19101-after.png?r=1587542683","url":"/styles/19101/metafilter-change-visited-link-color","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"metafilter.com\") {\r\n  a:visited {\r\n    color: #B79471 !important;\r\n  } \r\n}"}
