You have the option to remove the navigation bars up top if you do not use them. \r\n\r\nThe only issue I have found with this bit of coding is when you just happen to come across a posting picture with a width of 300px or height of 90px, because I used that reference to remove parts of the page. In the months I have used it, I have only come across one posting like that though, so not an issue imo.","user":{"id":58252,"name":"AlienPoison","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2010-08-01T12:00:53.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":218,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/35148_after.gif?r=1587542683","url":"/styles/35148/i-am-bored-com-absolute-minimum","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"i-am-bored.com\")\r\n{\r\n\r\n[height=\"90\"], [class=\"top_page_header\"], [width=\"300\"], [vspace=\"5\"],[alt=\"Advertisement\"], [style=\"margin: 3px auto 5px;\"]\r\n\r\n/*===== THE CODE BELOW REMOVES THE NAVAGATION BAR AND SUB NAVIAGTION BAR.
