TL;DR: nothing of any use has ever been said in the stickied posts.\r\n\r\nLonger version: The moderators of /r/tf2 seem to have a very narrow view of what /r/tf2 should be which means banning everything they dislike, no matter how minor, and seem to enjoy announcing rule changes as sticky posts on a daily basis. They also seem to enjoy stickying posts related to their personal interests, overriding the community choice to ignore or downvote stuff that we don't find interesting.","user":{"id":165015,"name":"goosmurf","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2015-01-28T13:01:04.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":174,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/77578-after.png?r=1589357004","url":"/styles/77578/reddit-tf2-remove-moderator-stupidity","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2\"), url-prefix(\"https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2\") {\r\ndiv.md h5 { display: none !important }\r\na.author:before {\r\n  content: \"\";\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiv.linklisting div.stickied { display: none } \r\n}"}
