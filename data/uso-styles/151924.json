There is also no point to the badly/un-managed Patreon linked in the widget. Seeing how neither is actually maintained by the admin in any real sense and the sidebar widget does nothing but clutter up the page, I figured a simple element hiding userstyle would not go amiss.","user":{"id":304796,"name":"DarkChaplain","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2017-11-25T13:18:47.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":31,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/151924_after.png?r=1587456310","url":"/styles/151924/thecolorless-net-donation-widget-hider","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"thecolorless.net\") {\r\ndiv.donations {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n    visibility: hidden !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}
