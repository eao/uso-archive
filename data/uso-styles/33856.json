This makes for a less-pleasant reading experience. This style aims to correct that.\r\n\r\nWhat it does:\r\n\r\n* Hides the ad at the left side of the page\r\n* Hides the ad in the \"leaderboard\" at the top of the page\r\n* Hides the headers of the various sections at the right of the screen.\r\n* Hides the background image, which looks awful in 16-bit color depth.\r\n\r\nWhat it does not do:\r\n\r\n* Hide the ad at the bottom of the page -- hiding this with CSS would hide the copyright notice.\r\n* Hide the ad at the right side of the page -- hiding this with CSS would hide the recent stories and many other useful things.\r\n\r\nThis is version 1.0. I may later rearrange parts of the site as I did with my \"Kerneltrap -- Simplified\" style (22730)","user":{"id":32803,"name":"mulenmar","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2010-07-20T17:43:09.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":127,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/33856_after.png?r=1588838707","url":"/styles/33856/phoronix-simplified","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"phoronix.com\") {\r\n\r\n/* Bye-bye background image that looks ugly at 16-bit color depth*/\r\n\r\nbody {\r\n   background-image: none !important ;\r\n   background-color: #000 !important;\r\n   }\r\n\r\n/* Bye-bye, left ad */\r\n\r\ndiv#phxcms_container div.phxcms_nav_int {\r\n   display: none ;\r\n   }\r\n\r\n/* We keep bottom ad to preserve copyright notice */\r\n\r\n/* Nice knowing you, right ad's header.\r\n * Wish we you send the ad with you without loosing the\r\n * latest news\r\n *\r\n * Of course, it's only right that we leave SOME advertising, it's a good site.   \r\n * Just . . . use the Flashblock add-on.\r\n */\r\n\r\ndiv.phxcms_header_legacy {\r\n   display: none ;\r\n   }\r\n\r\n/* Top ad, it's not that we don't like you... */\r\n\r\ndiv#phxcms_top_leaderboard {\r\n   display:none ;\r\n   }\r\n\r\n}"}
