Unfortunately, if you are going through month by month, scrolling through those thousands of usernames, it's difficult to find your friends because the only thing that makes them different from random strangers is a bold tag.\r\n\r\nWith this userstyle, your friends' names will be marked in RED, with a red BORDER and lots of MARGIN. It is virtually impossible to miss them even if you scroll through the list quickly.","user":{"id":35741,"name":"nilli","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-12-27T17:45:12.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":348,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/23652_after.png?r=1520640374","url":"/styles/23652/deviantart-birthdays-find-your-friends","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"birthdays.24bps.com\") {\r\n  .friend a {\r\n    margin: 1em !important;\r\n    padding: 1em !important;\r\n    background: #FF9 !important;\r\n    color: #F00 !important;\r\n    text-decoration: none !important;\r\n    border: dashed #F00 1px !important;\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n  }\r\n}"}
