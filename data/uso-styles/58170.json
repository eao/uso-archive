That way you can disable this style anytime you want the playlist/favorite bar to spawn at the bottom without moving anything to the video player.\r\n\r\nThis works great along with my other style: style 58169 The only difference is that this one works on every browser, every screen resolution.","user":{"id":127255,"name":"MasterAmateur","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2011-12-19T16:35:10.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1058,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/58170_after.jpeg?r=1588406924","url":"/styles/58170/remove-playlist-bar-favorites-bar-from-youtube","discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":1,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.youtube.com\") {\r\n#playlist-bar {\r\ndisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n#yt-feedback {\r\ndisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}
