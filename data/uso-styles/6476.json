{"id":6476,"name":"Autohide Menubar","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","style_tags":[],"description":"This style automatically hides the menu toolbar until you mouse over where it should be, i.e. above the navigation toolbar. When you mouse over, it reappears and rolls the other toolbars down below it. It disappears again when you move the mouse away.\r\n\r\nThis is great for saving vertical screen space and avoiding extensions which merely compact the menu toolbar into a single menu button.\r\n\r\nInspired by the Hide Menubar extension (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4762) which hides the menu until you press the Alt key, and NettiCat who submitted code for a mouse-based version rather than keyboard.\r\n\r\nCompatible with Firefox 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n**********\r\n\r\nTip: Add toolbar buttons to the menubar that you don't wish to clog up your regular toolbar. This way they are still there when you need them but out of the way when you don't. You may need to temporarily disable the style in order to drag buttons to the menubar.\r\n\r\n**********\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nNow hides the ugly 1 pixel solid line that was visible above the navigation bar when the menu toolbar was hidden. Unfortunately, this fix doesn't work for Firefox 3 though, however the style is still fully functional.","user":{"id":7848,"name":"leoncub.","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-04-16T17:49:36.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":3797,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/6476_after.png?r=1594541083","url":"/styles/6476/autohide-menubar","discussionsCount":10,"commentsCount":12,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\nAutohide Menubar\r\n\r\nmenu {\r\n  display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#toolbar-menubar {\r\n  height: 1px !important;\r\n  min-height: 1px !important;\r\n  overflow: hidden !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#toolbar-menubar:hover,\r\n#toolbar-menubar:focus,\r\n#toolbar-menubar:active {\r\n  height: auto !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#navigator-toolbox > #toolbar-menubar {\r\n  border-style: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#navigator-toolbox > #nav-bar {\r\n  border-top: 0px !important;\r\n}"}
