(based on your window size)\r\n-- My Feeds view: Flat and Rating.\r\n*/","user":{"id":3328,"name":"shigefumi","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"shigefumimemo@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2007-07-15T09:30:40.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":393,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/2879_after.png?r=1589616214","url":"/styles/2879/fastladder-more-feeds-in-flat-view","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(http://fastladder.com/reader/) {\r\n    .flat .treeitem {\r\n        height: 1em !important;\r\n        padding-bottom: 8px !important;\r\n    }\r\n/*\r\n    .flat .treeitem { height: auto !important; }\r\n*/\r\n}\r\n"}
