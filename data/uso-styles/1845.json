Removes the ads in the middle of articles and a few on the main page (on some pages I think); it also centers the text in the login box, because I like the way centered text looks.  I've only tested it on insider.ign.com.  Let me know how it works for you; suits my purposes just fine.","user":{"id":1869,"name":"The Ev","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2007-02-19T18:35:01.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1583,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/1845_after.gif?r=1588233931","url":"/styles/1845/ign-no-ads","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n/* Written by The Ev for his own purposes because he was annoyed with IGN ads */\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"ign.com\") {\r\n\r\n#MediumRectangleAd, #BillboardAd, #ad-wrap, #leaderboardAd, #HalfPageAd {display: none !important;}\r\n\r\n#loginBox {\r\ntext-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
