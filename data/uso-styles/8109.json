It also restricts its height so that it doesn't actually appear there (apart from a scroll bar on the right), and it uses a fake search button as a reminder for what it does. Move the mouse into the area between search button and scroll bar, and the foot of the page opens automagically there. Leave the area and it closes again.","user":{"id":6742,"name":"bitpicker","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"robinpfeifer@web.de","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-06-19T03:15:44.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":126,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/8109-after.png?r=1483747559","url":"/styles/8109/about-com-search-box-mover","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/* about.com Search Box Mover */\r\n\r\n/* This script moves the new search box to a top position\r\n   and makes it pop up on mouse hover */\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"forums.about.com\") {\r\n\r\ndiv#ptcBrandFooter.ptcWrapperHeader {\r\nbackground-image:url(http://z.about.com/i/d/spb.gif) !important;\r\nbackground-repeat:no-repeat !important;\r\nbackground-position:-328px 10px !important;\r\nposition:absolute !important;\r\ntop:135px !important;\r\nmax-height:1px !important;\r\noverflow:auto;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiv#ptcBrandFooter.ptcWrapperHeader:hover {\r\nmax-height:330px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiv#ptcBodyDiv {\r\nposition:relative !important;\r\ntop:70px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
