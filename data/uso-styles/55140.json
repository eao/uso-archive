So I added a few features to make it easier:\r\n- Different colour links\r\n- Underlined links\r\n- Margin to separate items from lists of links\r\n- Different colour to identify links when you hover over them\r\nIn fact it just makes the list of options on the right and left hand side menus more user friendly by increasing margins, making visited links gray, and underlining and highlighting links.","user":{"id":57584,"name":"lu_","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"luiscarlosrubino@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2011-10-20T12:22:23.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":124,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/55140_after.png?r=1573113671","url":"/styles/55140/learn-to-love-you-more","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"learningtoloveyoumore.com\") {\r\n\r\na:link {\r\ntext-decoration: underline !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\na:hover {\r\ncolor: red !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\np {\r\nmargin: 10px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\np a.names:visited  {\r\ncolor: grey !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
