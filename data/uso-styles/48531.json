Black and maroon colors. \r\nI made this to go with this background: http://tinyurl.com/3hz4mom because I didn't really like the logo it came with...so yea. The before picture is the logo that the said background came with. The after is my logo. So, please enjoy :)\r\nhttp://aripotta.tumblr.com/\r\n\r\nUPDATE (8/23/13): I see now that tinypic has deleted my picture. I don't know why exactly. The computer I created this logo on crashed some time ago and I do not have the ability to upload it again. I will, however, try to recreate it. No ETA available, but know that I have every intention on uploading it as quickly as possible. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, cheryy-lipz.\r\n\r\nIf you like this logo, please keep checking the description every other day or so to find out if it's up. I'm really sorry about this. Thank you for your understanding.","user":{"id":103143,"name":"cereal0147","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2011-05-29T22:26:43.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":55787,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/48531_after.png?r=1588665963","url":"/styles/48531/tumblr-dashboard-maroon-harry-potter-logo","discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":4,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix('http://www.tumblr.com/'), url-prefix('https://www.tumblr.com/')   {\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#logo {height: 0 !important;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\twidth: 0 !important;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tpadding-left: 230px !important;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tpadding-top: 120px !important;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tbackground: url(http://i54.tinypic.com/33f9fuv.png) no-repeat !important;}}\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n"}
