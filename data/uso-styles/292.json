Problem was I couldn't get the image to work, and then found a character map symbol which worked in Stylish, but not in userContent.  I've put the image BEFORE the link, and rewritten the code more precisely  thanks to Paweï¿½ Kubisz (cyberrus) and the PDF icon script  (\"a[href]\") - and come up with this PNG/base 64 version which works BOTH in Stylish and userContent.  I'm grateful to marcanth for finding this as now, even with my black background Google IMage Search script in effect, I still get an indicator of \"visited image\" as well as links (see screenshots).","user":{"id":15,"name":"Paulfox","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2006-04-20T18:54:52.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":2418,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/292_after.gif?r=1588493039","url":"/styles/292/visited-links-png-image-based-on-marcanth-s","discussionsCount":8,"commentsCount":8,"css":"/*Coded by Paulfox April 20th 2006, based on original script by marcanth */\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\na[href]:visited:before { content: url(\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAkAAAAMCAYAAACwXJejAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAGElEQVQYlWP8b2z8n4EAYCKkYFTRQCgCADY%2BAnyGRbu9AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\");  padding-right:5px; }"}
