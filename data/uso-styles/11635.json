{"id":11635,"name":"gMail right-side labels margin","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","style_tags":[],"description":"Theory: gmail labs rock :)\r\nThere are two beautiful features: right-side chat and right-side labels, and I will call them RSC and RSL for the moment. Both features had a top margin of 10px so they were not top aligned with the middle huge div (with light-blue background and round corners, you know it). The RSC feature had been fixed but the other one not... I posted some messages on the discussion group, I saw others posting on the same topic but there were no moves, so I made one.\r\nThis style moves the RSL 10px top margin to bottom (yellow highlighted in the before/after screenshots); but there is a problem: the same class is used by the left-side menu [inbox, starred, chats...] so I placed another 10px bottom margin to the \"Compose Mail\" button. And the problem was solved. I tried the style without lab features and it didn't screw anything but if you find irregularities please post a review or email me: vlad[at]nastasiu[dot]com\r\nThanks and enjoy.","user":{"id":16131,"name":"vladootz","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-10-28T10:01:35.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":416,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/11635_after.png?r=1591430685","url":"/styles/11635/gmail-right-side-labels-margin","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"google.com\") {\r\n  .LYZ5re {\r\n    margin-top: 0px !important;\r\n    margin-bottom: 10px;\r\n  }\r\n  .cOSVMd {\r\n    margin-bottom: 10px;\r\n  }\r\n}"}
