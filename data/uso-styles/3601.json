Looking around for a fix - I found out if you removed the toggle between the menu and body of Google Reader it would fix the problem.  Hopefully this is only a temp. fix till Google gets things corrected.  First public user style - so be nice. ;)","user":{"id":4205,"name":"Mitch","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2007-09-27T06:13:15.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":1011,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/3601_after.gif?r=1596960415","url":"/styles/3601/fix-google-widescreen-view","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.google.com/reader/\"), url-prefix(\"https://www.google.com/reader/\") {\r\n\r\n\r\n/* remove toggler */\r\n#nav-toggler {\r\n  display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}
