{"id":101434,"name":"More Readable Tab Text","category":"app","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"style_tags":[],"description":"When you install a theme that uses bright text, sometimes the tab in focus becomes unnecessarily hard to read because Firefox makes the tab brighter by default.\r\n[The fact that themes as a whole haven't been designed to let the creators change text colours in a slightly more specific way is, clearly, the work of GENIUS. But whatever]\r\n\r\nThis style removes the often annoying glow (\"shadows\") from the text and sets the colour of the title of the tab in focus to black.\r\n\r\nWorks best with somewhat uniformly coloured (i.e. \"solid\") and dark themes. (personally I recommend Solid Royal, it's one of the few whose goal isn't to kill your eyes and lose your bookmarks)","user":{"id":53226,"name":"skiuh","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2014-05-13T00:11:56.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":356,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/101434_after.png?r=1565596884","url":"/styles/101434/more-readable-tab-text","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix('chrome://') {\r\n\r\n#toolbar-menubar\r\n  {\r\n  text-shadow: none !important;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n#main-menubar menu\r\n  {\r\n  text-shadow: none !important;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n\r\n.tab-text[selected=\"true\"] {color:black !important;}\r\n\r\n.tabbrowser-tab { text-shadow: none !important; }\r\n\t\r\n}"}
