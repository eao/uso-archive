I tried to reduce the clutter ( style 4328 ), but that doesn't help the load time.\r\n\r\nThen I discovered Amazon has a mobile site (http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw), which is virtually text-only (small icons and cover pics), and lightning-quick. Works well in a sidebar, too.\r\n\r\nI felt that it could use space a little more efficiently though. And removed a couple of categories I'm never going to use.","user":{"id":5140,"name":"timepiece","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"debmorrissey@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-11-18T18:40:36.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":793,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/5883-after.png?r=1595405243","url":"/styles/5883/amazon-anywhere","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw\") {\r\n\r\n/* * { max-width: 210px!important; } for sidebar/gadget use - delete otherwise */\r\nBODY { font-size: small; }\r\n\r\nHR, INPUT + BR, A + A + A + A + BR,  FONT[size=\"-1\"], \r\nIMG[alt=\"Auto\"], IMG[alt=\"Photo \"], IMG[alt=\"Sporting Goods \"], IMG[alt=\"Wireless \"], IMG[alt=\"ETC \"], IMG[alt=\"Magazines \"] { \r\n    display: none; } /* remove unnecessary elements, couple of \"stores\" */\r\n\r\nA > IMG { width: 22px!important; height: 22px!important; }\r\n\r\nLEFT > P:first-child { margin: -10px 0 0 0; } /* move logo up */\r\n}"}
