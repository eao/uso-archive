Even with 1024 in width, you have to scroll to the right to read the posts.\r\nSo even while just being a lurker on the noot' forum, I created this to be able to read more efficiently.\r\nThey should have made the column as a separately loaded script instead of being in the main file, then it could be blocked using Adblock Plus... Or just scrap it and use a horizontal menu at the top.","user":{"id":126362,"name":"luminatus","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2012-01-19T05:19:25.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":103,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/57833-after.png?r=1570867284","url":"/styles/57833/longecity-org-left-column-removal","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n/*Made by Luminatus.
