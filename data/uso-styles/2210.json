To exit, click on the windows keyboard button, then right-click on the firefox task in the taskbar which the flash page is opened and choose close. You can use Alt-Tab to naviguate between windows.\r\n\r\nNote : Slow computers will read flashes even slower!\r\n\r\nFuture : I will try to do a style for the \"pop-in\" way to open flashes but this is a lot more difficult. style 3103 by user 202 does that but is not complete (margins problems and lack of the usefull x button).","user":{"id":2405,"name":"Szeety","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-02-10T11:41:29.000Z","weekly_install_count":2,"total_install_count":1596,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":null,"url":"/styles/2210/flashes-on-newgrounds-at-full-screen-100","discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2,"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/viewer.php\") {\r\n div, embed{\r\n  width:100% !important;\r\n  height:100% !important;\r\n  padding:0 !important;\r\n }\r\n .boxtop, .headsizer, .hr, .popadtext, br, .boxbot\r\n  {display:none !important;}\r\n}"}
