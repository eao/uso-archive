Take back control.\r\n\r\nBonus: This UserStyle also forces the 'report' button and upvote arrows to always be visible.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n<b>Found a subreddit without downvote arrows?</b>\r\nThis code should cover every subreddit possible; however, if you happen to find a sneaky subreddit that managed to find a way around it feel free to contact me (see below) with the subreddit so I can make code additions/adjustments.\r\n\r\nLeave feedback in the <i>Discussions</i> or PM me on reddit (<a href=\"http://reddit.com/user/zants\">zants</a>) if you have any tips or helpful suggestions. :)","user":{"id":79998,"name":"zants","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://tad.im","about":null,"license":"ccby"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2013-08-16T19:31:55.000Z","weekly_install_count":7,"total_install_count":2824,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/78675_after.png?r=1597392577","url":"/styles/78675/reddit-always-show-downvote-arrows","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.reddit.com\"), domain(\"reddit.com\") {\r\n    .sitetable .arrow, body:not(.subscriber) .arrow, #siteTable .arrow.down, #siteTable .arrow.up, .link .arrow.down, .link .arrow.up, .link .arrow.downmod, .link .arrow.upmod {\r\n        display: block !important;\r\n        visibility: visible !important;\r\n    }\r\n    .link .midcol {\r\n        display: block !important;\r\n        visibility: visible !important;\r\n        height: auto !important;\r\n    }\r\n    .score {\r\n        visibility: visible !important;\r\n    }\r\n    .toggle.report-button {\r\n        display: inline !important;\r\n        visibility: visible !important;\r\n    }\r\n}"}
