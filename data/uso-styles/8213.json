Just installed it on a new reinstall (less than an hour old) of the release candidate and I am still happy with this style. I suggest you go with a different style or create your own if you do not like mine.\r\n\r\nThank you to those who actually did like the improvements I made.","user":{"id":11539,"name":"Thor79","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-06-21T17:57:18.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1277,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/8213_after.png?r=1580112071","url":"/styles/8213/awesomebar-results-sized-down","discussionsCount":5,"commentsCount":6,"css":"@-moz-document url(\"chrome://browser/content/browser.xul\")\r\n{\r\n\r\n.autocomplete-richlistitem\r\n{\r\nheight: 26px !important;\r\noverflow: hidden !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.ac-title\r\n{\r\nmargin-top: -7px;\r\nfont-size: 85%;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.ac-url\r\n{\r\nmargin-top:-16px;\r\nfont-size: 90%;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
