However hiding them with an ad blocker or other method (in specific, hiding `.left.gutter` and `.right.gutter`) presents a different layout problem:\r\nThe article content is displayed in a narrow space on the left side of the page and there is a huge amount of empty space to the right of it. This script narrows the page content (to 1280px), centers them, and removes the empty space.","user":{"id":292471,"name":"Shabadadu","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2015-05-29T20:02:44.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":715,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/114467_after.jpeg?r=1597305985","url":"/styles/114467/fix-ann-s-broken-layout-caused-by-hiding-ads","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"animenewsnetwork.com\"),\r\n               domain(\"animenewsnetwork.co.uk\") {\r\n  /* Short description of ANN DOM structure we care about:\r\n   * body - The background image is attached to it.\r\n   *  div.left.gutter - A container for the ad on the left; should be hidden by the ad blocker\r\n   *  div#canvas - All the actual content, and some ads that don't seem to cause any problems when hidden\r\n   *  div.right.gutter - a container for the ad on the right; should be hidden by the ad blocker\r\n   * \r\n   * The layout problem that arises by hiding the ads .left.gutter and .right.gutter is that\r\n   * the article content is displayed in a narrow space on the left side of the page and there\r\n   * is a huge amount of empty space to the right of it.\r\n   * This script narrows the page content (to 1280px), centers them, and removes the empty space.\r\n   */\r\n  \r\n  /* Set the max-width property of all div descendants of #canvas */\r\n  #canvas div {\r\n    max-width: 1280px !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  /* Set the width of the div children of #canvas and of #main and center them vertically */\r\n  #canvas > div, #main {\r\n    width: 1280px !important;\r\n    margin: auto !important;\r\n  }\r\n    \r\n  /* Hide the background image and make it a solid gray color.
