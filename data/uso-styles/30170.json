This style helps those of us using multiple columns of results or the Googlepedia addon (though Googlepedia may have been fixed recently, I do not know), by expanding the area for the results.\r\n\r\nSize not right?  Just change the value in the script to exactly what works for you.\r\n\r\n*Update*\r\nShould now work on searches directly from the Google main page.  If it doesn't, post the userscript or addon that you want to make work and I'll edit it.","user":{"id":50155,"name":"PiiSPii","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2010-07-20T13:20:15.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":337,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":null,"url":"/styles/30170/extend-google-results-page","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.google.ca\"), domain(\"www.google.com\"), domain(\"www.google.co.uk\"), domain(\"www.google.com.au\") {\r\n\r\n#ires {\r\nwidth: 1450px !important;\r\n      }\r\n\r\nspan[id=\"search\"], #multi_column_view {\r\nwidth: 1450px !important;\r\n      }\r\n}"}
