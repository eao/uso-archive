If important parts of the theme are missing and do not appear as you believe they should from the screenshots, please contact me and I will try to resolve it.","license":"ccby"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2015-03-03T12:50:39.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":103,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/111104_after.png?r=1587974607","url":"/styles/111104/wtfismyip-com-solarized-dark","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"wtfismyip.com\") {\r\n  \r\n  body {\r\n    background-color: #002b36;\r\n    color: #839496;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  a:link, a:visited, #tor {\r\n    color: #cb4b16;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  #sidebar h2 {\r\n    color: #93a1a1;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}"}
