This style hides all the \"personal\" links, the \"Gigs - Adult\", and the \"Services - Adult\", and some \"tempting\" areas of Craigslist. Please use this as a starting point and make yours more or less \"adult\" as you see fit. Great for reducing the temptations of the flesh :)","user":{"id":45122,"name":"brimoore","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2010-03-22T23:56:34.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":254,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":null,"url":"/styles/26550/craigslist-personals-and-adult-stuff-hider","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(craigslist.org){\r\ndiv[id$=\"ppp\"],\r\na[href$=\"ID=72\"],\r\na[href$=\"ID=46\"],\r\na[href$=\"ID=69\"],\r\na[href$=\"ID=97\"],\r\na[href$=\"ID=200269\"],\r\na[href$=\"category=adg\"],\r\na[href$=\"category=ads\"]\r\n{display:none !important;}\r\n} "}
