The first one is for groups/school forums, and the second one is for the regular MySpace forums.)\r\n\r\nEDIT: I added \"blockquote blockquote\" to the list which gets rid of blockquotes that're in blockquotes. This removes multiple quotes in posts. :) For anyone who's annoyed by pages that're looooong because the posters are too lazy to remove some damn quotes. (NOTE: This does not remove the quotes when you quote a post, it just hides them!)","user":{"id":12244,"name":"Dakata","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-08-20T11:27:05.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":403,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/8740-after.png?r=1588233931","url":"/styles/8740/myspace-forum-cleaner","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/*\r\nUserstyle by Dakata\r\nhttp://userstyles.org/users/12244\r\nhttp://angstdragon.co.nr\r\n\r\nLast updated August 20th, '08\r\n*/\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"myspace.com\") {\r\n a.sendmsg, div.aboutuser, div.sidetwo, div.ForumSubTitle,  span.breadCrumb#ctl00_ctl00_cpMain_CommonTop_BreadCrumb1, select#ctl00_ctl00_cpMain_bcr_SorterTop_SorterTop, li.ForumPostUserAttribute, li.ForumPostListLinks, td.ForumPostFooterArea, select#ctl00_ctl00_cpMain_bcr_PostListSorter1_PostListSorter1, blockquote blockquote, div#footer {\r\n\tdisplay: none !important;} }"}
