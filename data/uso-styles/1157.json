{"id":1157,"name":"Torrent-Finder.com UPDATED Search Result cleaner","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"torrent-finder","subcategory":"torrent-finder","style_tags":[],"description":"This script will remove all ads and junk so you end up just with the search result tabs and one scrollbar. It will not clean the main page. \r\n\r\nEDIT 061106: They just changed the ads a bit. This update removes them too. The questions below are still unanswered. The problem with the div at top is that it has no tag at all. Can you say: \"remove the 2nd DIV\", and if so, how?\r\n\r\nSince this is my first userstyle I have some questions:\r\n\r\n1. How do I get rid of the \"<<Back to search || Search here >>\" div at the top?\r\n\r\n2. How do I make the iframe fill the browser height dynamically instead of having it fixed?
