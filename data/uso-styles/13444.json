I wrote this style sheet because it's almost impossible to tell when the replies begin or end.\r\n\r\nUpdate (7/31/09): \r\nFixed again for the new layout. There are now comments in the CSS. This style can be loaded as a userscript into the developer version of chrome. There are now shadow borders around the comments.\r\n\r\nUpdate (3/13/09): \r\nShortly after the last update stylish updated and dropped use of \"offset.\" \r\nI have fixed by going back to using padding and by changing the overflow setting.\r\n\r\nUpdate (2/2/09): \r\nFixed the comment cutoff ugliness. You will need to tell stylish to \"use code as is\" because the style now uses \"offset\" instead of \"padding-left.\" Sorry about the inconvenience.","user":{"id":12204,"name":"amoose136","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-07-31T23:15:19.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":439,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/13444_after.png?r=1588752331","url":"/styles/13444/lifehacker-comment-indention","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"lifehacker.com\") {\r\n.toplevel_comment {\t\t\t\t/*______For any comment not in reply to another comment:_____*/\r\n\t-moz-border-radius: 5px;\t\t/* <- Corners for Firefox */\r\n\t-webkit-border-radius: 5px;\t\t/* <- Corners for Chrome and Safari */\r\n\t-moz-box-shadow: 0 0 5px #9d5;\t\t/* <- Shadows for Firefox */\r\n\t-webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 5px #9d5;\t/* <- Shadows for Chrome and Safari */\r\n}\r\n.replylevel_comment {\t\t\t\t/*________For reply comments:________*/\r\n\t-moz-border-radius: 3px;\t\t/* <- Corners for Firefox */\r\n\t-webkit-border-radius: 3px;\t\t/* <- Corners for Chrome and Safari */\r\n\t-moz-box-shadow: 0 0 3px #282;\t\t/* <- Shadows for Firefox */\r\n\t-webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 3px #282;\t/* <- Shadows for Chrome and Safari */\r\n\tmargin-left: 5em !important;\t\t/* <- The actual reply shifter */\r\n}\r\n}"}
