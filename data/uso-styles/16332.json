{"id":16332,"name":"New Facebook' - Minimize/Simplify Highlights Area","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"facebook","subcategory":"facebook","style_tags":[],"description":"This style does two main things:\r\n\r\n1) It shortens the 'highlights' area found on the home page after the most recent update, and adds a scroll bar. This makes it a bit easier to see the items found beneath the highlights area (like pokes, friends you may know, etc.)\r\n\r\n2) It removes the image/video preview pictures found with each highlight story. Again, I didn't find the previews to add anything useful to it, and this is a little more space efficient.","user":{"id":11558,"name":"aedes","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-03-23T18:02:13.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1679,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/16332-after.png?r=1589529796","url":"/styles/16332/new-facebook-minimize-simplify-highlights-area","discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"facebook.com\") {\r\n\r\n.UIHotStream.UIStream {\r\n  height:180px!important;\r\n  overflow-y:auto!important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.UIHotStory_Media {\r\n  display:none!important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\n"}
