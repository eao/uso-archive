Whenever you hate it, just turn OFF this style with your Stylish/GreaseMonkey button on the status-bar (if you leave the button there).","user":{"id":12783,"name":"Lam Edh","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-08-12T06:00:47.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":464,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/9239_after.png?r=1592208477","url":"/styles/9239/douban-fixed-width-font-simsun","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"douban.com\"), domain(\"douban.net\")\r\n{\r\n\r\n* {font-family: å®‹ä½“, SimSun !important }\r\n\r\n}"}
