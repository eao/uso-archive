Choose between his and mine, I'm not sure how much better or worse mine are! WEBKIT BROWSERS ONLY (Chromium, Safari, ect. - NOT Firefox).\r\n\r\nNEW - Mozilla version: style 46044.\r\n\r\nDifferences to Aeroboy's extension:\r\n - Transparency on all scrollbars except the far outer ones.\r\n - Change of colour on hover and mouse down.\r\n - Thinner.\r\n - Possible other things I have forgotten.\r\n\r\nScreenshot notes:\r\n - Them two scrollbars in \"after\" really are the same colour, it's an optical illusion! Even I (who wrote the code) had to check this in Paint.\r\n - The scrollbar in \"before\" is from an XP theme I have downloaded (i.e. the system default).\r\n - The screenshots are from this page (the edit page), with style 44215 activated.","user":{"id":90468,"name":"m1n1f1g","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2011-04-10T02:58:20.000Z","weekly_install_count":11,"total_install_count":8618,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/44449_after.png?r=1597392577","url":"/styles/44449/simple-scrollbars","discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2,"css":"::-webkit-scrollbar {\r\n  width: 9px;\r\n  height: 9px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n::-webkit-scrollbar-track-piece {\r\n  background-color: transparent;\r\n}\r\n\r\nbody::-webkit-scrollbar-track-piece {\r\n  background-color: white;\r\n}\r\n\r\n::-webkit-scrollbar-track-piece:no-button {}\r\n\r\n::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {\r\n  background-color: #7D7D7D;\r\n  border-radius: 3px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover {\r\n  background-color: #999;\r\n}\r\n\r\n::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:active {\r\n  background-color: #666;\r\n}"}
