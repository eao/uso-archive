If you don't get those options, you haven't clicked the right section.\r\n\r\nDoing that will load Farmville on its own, which allows the style to make it take up 98% of the screen, filling the other 2% with a margin to keep it centered. Now you can have almost full screen Farmville and still do other things at the same time =D","user":{"id":20918,"name":"dsDev.io","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"dave@daveshoreman.com","homepage":"http://dsdev.io","about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-09-18T22:26:54.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1415,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/20854_after.png?r=1588233931","url":"/styles/20854/facebook-farmville-stretch-to-fit","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":3,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"fbpr1.farmville.zynga.com\") {\r\ndiv[style=\"width: 760px; height: 594px;\"] {width:98%!important;height:98%!important;margin:1%!important;}\r\nobject{width:100%!important;height:100%!important;}\r\n}"}
