The choice is of course entirely yours.\r\n\r\nf you set the Opacity value to 0.0 (zero) then the cell will become  completely Transparent.\r\nIf you set the Opacity to 1.0 (One) it will have no Transparency at all.\r\n(The values in between are  0.1 to 0.9 ) \r\n\r\nWith this added option to change Opacity on Hover, you can have two different settings, one for normal use and one for hover.\r\n\r\nNot to be confused with Transparent Logos which are explained here:\r\nhttp://userlogos.org/node/461\r\n\r\nThis opacity fix will unfortunately not resolve Transparency difficulties with Transparent Logos encountered in FD 1.x  when using FF2.\r\n\r\nIf you are successfully using Transparent  Logos in FD 1.x  in FF3 it is possible  that your interest in opacity may be limited to dialing cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPictures below\r\n\r\n(opacity 0.3)---->----(opacity 0.6 on hover)","user":{"id":4921,"name":"chiaroscuro","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-08-03T14:06:35.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":731,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/9309_after.gif?r=1580198468","url":"/styles/9309/fast-dial-v1-x-only-transparency-with-hover","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url(\"about:blank\") {\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*-----for dialling cells-----*/\r\n\r\n.image\r\n{\r\nopacity: 0.5;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.image:hover\r\n{\r\nopacity: 0.0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n/*-----for cells with group-----*/\r\n\r\n.parent\r\n{\r\nopacity: 0.5;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.parent:hover\r\n{\r\nopacity: 0.0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
