If important parts of the theme are missing and do not appear as you believe they should from the screenshots, please contact me and I will try to resolve it.","license":"ccby"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2015-03-04T02:51:19.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":88,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/111124-after.png?r=1590912253","url":"/styles/111124/stallman-org-solarized-dark","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"stallman.org\") {\r\n  \r\n  body {\r\n    background-color: #002b36;\r\n    font-family: Sans Serif;\r\n    color: #839496;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  :link {\r\n    color: #268bd2;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}"}
