In message threads, if viewed on Firefox 3, the cryptic message\r\n\r\nh2 {font-size: 10pt !important;}\r\n\r\nturns up in the top area just before the actual thread title. A sloppy programmer has tried to insert a style tag at this point where it doesn't belong at all (its place, if used at all, is in the head area of the page, not the body) , and FF 3 displays it as text, ignoring the tag. The fix makes style tags invisible (as they should be).","user":{"id":6742,"name":"bitpicker","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"robinpfeifer@web.de","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-10-05T10:19:37.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":203,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/10999-after.png?r=1589616214","url":"/styles/10999/about-com-remove-h2-error-on-ff-3","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"forums.about.com\") {\r\n\r\nstyle {\r\ndisplay:none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
