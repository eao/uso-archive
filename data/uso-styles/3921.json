If anyone finds another problem while using my style, post a review telling me about it and I'll see what I can do.","user":{"id":4575,"name":"FreeBee","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"paypal@fessie.cjb.net","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2007-10-26T01:19:58.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":2867,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/3921-after.png?r=1588061121","url":"/styles/3921/google-improved-ad-remover","discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2,"css":"/*remove google ad*/\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(google.com), url-prefix( http://www.google.) {\r\ntable[style=\"\"][align=\"right\"],    /* froogle */\r\ndiv[ads],                          /* google  */\r\ndiv[id^=tpa],                      /* google  */\r\ndiv[spl],                          /* google  */\r\ntable[width=\"25%\"][align=\"right\"], /* google  */\r\ntable[class=lads],                 /* google  */\r\ndiv[class=\"rh\"]                    /* mail    */\r\n{display: none !important;}\r\n}\r\n"}
