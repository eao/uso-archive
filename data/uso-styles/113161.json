Sadly though AdBlockPlus may remove the ad it sometimes has trouble removing the space left behind. I had made the attempt to try and remove the space through AdBlock but was not successful. I have only ever tested this on Google Chrome, I'm not sure what effect it will have on other browsers.","user":{"id":290496,"name":"Umbreeunix","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"umbreecommissions@gmail.com","homepage":"http://umbreeunix.tumblr.com/","about":"Not really much of a coder, but I'm working on getting better so whatever codes I end up making will be posted here.\r\n\r\nAlso nobody needs to send me money through this site, I'm just putting my PayPal email here because... well I just wanted to fill out the info.
