Here's what's changed:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The player controls (play, pause etc) are on the left next to the album artwork. I found it annoying to be navigating on the left side of the screen then make the long stretch to the right side to hit next.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>As a result of the above point, the progress bar for the song has been moved to the right side of the play controls and is longer than default, giving more accuracy to your progress scrubbing.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Removes the \"Buy Song\" option from the context menu on songs.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Removes the Explicit icon for songs that just looks so out of place and messes up the text aligning.</li>\r\n</ul>","user":{"id":463414,"name":"McHoneDog","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2017-07-18T06:42:22.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":30,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/145380_after.png?r=1588061121","url":"/styles/145380/microsoft-groove-music-fixes","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/* Maintained by Michael Honan 2017-07-18 */\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"music.microsoft.com\") {\r\n/* Set the right play controls position */\r\n.player .playerControls {\r\n    left: 280px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Set the right progress bar position */\r\n.player .playerDuration {\r\n    left: 660px;\r\n    width: calc(100% - 650px);\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Changes the colour of the now playing element */\r\ndiv#player > div:nth-child(3) {\r\n\tbackground-color: #e0e0e0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Removes the store item */\r\ndiv#navigation ul.navigationList li:nth-child(4) {\r\n\tdisplay: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Removes the 'Buy Song' from the context menu on songs. */\r\ndiv.modalContent ul.navigationList.leftIcons li:nth-child(3) {\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Removes the explicit icon to the right of the song name. */\r\ndiv.primaryMetadata span.warningLabel {\r\n  display: none; \r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
