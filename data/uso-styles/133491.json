After noticing that many of the sites I use regularly didn't have any dark styles (or any styles at all for that matter), I decided to upload my own for any other sufferers (or just anyone else who likes a darker look) to use. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am in no way an expert. I am aware that most of my styles are far from perfect, but they work for what I use them for. I learned a lot of what I know from just looking at other people's styles I've used in the past; as such, everyone is welcome to make whatever changes are needed to my styles to suit their own usage/tastes (if you need help, just ask).\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who has contributed to this great utility, and eternal thanks to Stylish for being exactly what lets me enjoy the web!\r\n\r\nPS. I use the FT DeepDark theme and styles for Firefox by Steva/Sr21, so my dark color scheme is similar to that (although I make mine a touch darker). If you want different colors, everything should be easily changeable.","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2016-10-05T21:45:14.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":338,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/133491_after.jpeg?r=1597392577","url":"/styles/133491/youtube-colored-visited-links-nova","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.youtube.com\") { \r\n  \r\n.video-list-item a:visited .title, .yt-lockup-title a:visited, .yt-lockup-byline a:visited\r\n{color: #00668c !important;}  \r\n}"}
