To prevent that, remove the margin-left and margin-right settings (page will only be centered vertically afterwards).\r\n\r\nEdit: Good to see this style is still liked (and still works in Firefox 3.0). And it doesn't seem to break this site any more, either.\r\nThanks for the reviews. I don't think you can add exceptions for single pages. Also, this style might break in future versions because changing the style of the HTML node is sort of a hack and is afaik not standards conform.\r\nWell, whatever, keep enjoying it as long as possible.","user":{"id":194,"name":"derula","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2006-05-03T07:29:17.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":4016,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/337_after.png?r=1593504441","url":"/styles/337/center-all-pages","discussionsCount":5,"commentsCount":5,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\nhtml {\r\n  height:100% !important;\r\n  display:table !important;\r\n  margin-left: auto !important;\r\n  margin-right: auto !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nbody {\r\n  display:table-cell !important;\r\n  vertical-align: middle !important;\r\n}"}
