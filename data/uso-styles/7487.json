The biggest downside is that the site is really ugly. I, for some reason, believe that the quotes should be in monospace. Also, they should be the same colors as my terminal. So I made a quick style that does that and a few other things. Most of them make it a lot easier to read, and easier on the eyes. Some I use just because I like them.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n-quotes monospace\r\n-black background, green text\r\n-get rid of admin link, paypal link, and go to # box.\r\n-the entire page is narrower, 60% vs the old 80%, so there is less eye movement.\r\n-borders, padding, etc.\r\n-streamlined in general\r\n-fix front page breakage\r\n\r\nIt took all of two minutes, so not too many complaints.\r\n\r\n* update 11/28/08\r\n     uploading a few small changes I have made over time.","user":{"id":7743,"name":"Dman","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-11-28T19:36:30.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":932,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/7487_after.png?r=1589357004","url":"/styles/7487/bash-org-qdb-restyle","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(bash.org) {\r\n* {\r\nmargin:0 !important;\r\npadding:0 !important;\r\n}\r\nbody {\r\nbackground-color:#000 !important;\r\n}\r\ntd p.qt {\r\nfont-family:monospace !important;\r\nline-height:1.5 !important;\r\ncolor:#00ff00 !important;\r\nborder:1px #666666 solid !important;\r\npadding:5px !important;\r\nmargin-top:2px !important;\r\n/*font-weight:700;*/\r\n}\r\np.quote {\r\ncolor:#00ff00 !important;\r\n}\r\na {\r\ncolor:#005500 !important;\r\ntext-decoration:underline;\r\n}\r\na:hover {\r\ncolor:#00ee00 !important;\r\n}\r\na.qa {\r\nfont-weight:600 !important;\r\n}\r\ntable {\r\nwidth:60% !important\r\n}\r\ntd {\r\nbackground-color:#111111 !important;\r\ncolor:#ffffff !important;\r\npadding:3px !important;\r\n}\r\na[href=\"./?admin\"], a[href^=https], input[type=text] {\r\ndisplay:none;\r\n}\r\nul {\r\nmargin-left:20px !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}
