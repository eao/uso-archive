Chat with your Facebook friends using Digsby's interface, and rid your browser of any annoying duplicate conversation slide-ups that appear on any open Facebook pages.\r\n\r\nThis style hides all conversation elements, and that is all that it hides.  Applications that appear on the left side of the bottom bar still appear as normal.  The \"Online Friends\" button still appears as normal.  The \"Quick Notifications\" button and the \"My Chat Status\" button still appear as normal.","user":{"id":17082,"name":"Shawn C","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"shawnchristy@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-12-28T17:20:46.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":10529,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/13350-after.png?r=1594973387","url":"/styles/13350/facebook-bottom-bar-hide-conversations","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"facebook.com\") {\r\n\r\n.tab_handle { display: none !important; }\r\n.tab_button_div { display: none !important; }\r\n.tab_hit_area { display: none !important; }\r\n}"}
