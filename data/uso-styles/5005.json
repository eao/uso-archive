Feel free to hack it or use the bits you can use for anything else.\r\n\r\n[update 2008-04-20 : rewritten to work with \"mb3\" (sorry haven't visited mb for some time so maybe the old one was inoperable for a longer time..)]\r\n[update 2008-04-25 : inclusion instead of exclusion in top level (=smaller), also automatically ignores the random new stuff in the header they include]\r\n[update 2008-08-31 : forgot to upload the latest changes and only noticed on a new machine - so here is it fixed (for now...)]","user":{"id":5911,"name":"unmei","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-08-31T13:59:31.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":267,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/5005_after.png?r=1589270581","url":"/styles/5005/moeboard-net-bare-post-images-page-navi","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"moeboard.net\") {\r\nBODY > *:not(#mbContainer) { display: none !important; }\r\n#mbContainer > *:not(#mbRight) { display: none !important; }\r\n#mbRight > marquee { display: none !important; } \r\n#mbRight > center { display: none !important; }\r\nHR { display:none; }\r\n.postcont { display:none; }\r\n.cmt_container { display:none; }\r\n}"}
