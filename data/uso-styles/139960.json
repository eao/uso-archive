{"id":139960,"name":"Userstyles.org - Remove \"Statistics Table\" Boxes","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"userstyles.org","subcategory":"userstyles.org","style_tags":[],"description":"This user style is for all those who feel the new Userstyles.org page layout for the user styles (which now includes <b>boxes/borders around the \"statistics table\"</b>) is an <b>annoyingly ugly</b> change. The boxes were first introduced in early March 2017. Those boxed borders surround the user style's entries for \"Author\", \"License\", \"Created\" date, \"Updated\" date, \"Installs (this week)\", \"Installs (total)\", \"Average Rating\", and \"Show/Hide CSS\". This user style simply removes those boxes, returning the layout to exactly the way it was pre-March 2017. The screenshot tells the whole story about this style. (Of course, this style can be used in addition, and simultaneously, to any other Userstyles.org style a user wants to employ - this style just adds the one change of removing the boxes - there is only 1 CSS rule in the code).","user":{"id":298434,"name":"R.
