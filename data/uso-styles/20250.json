I have a lot of folders/projects, a lot of contexts and so on. The number of tabs are much more then screen width can fit. So I wrote this style to convert this tabs to plane list in right column.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this styles is pretty raw and maybe you will need to play around with widths and margins in it to fit your screen resolution. And of course if this hack will be usefull, I`ll try to make it more universal.","user":{"id":26856,"name":"Di.Mon","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-08-17T07:47:38.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":783,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/20250_after.png?r=1587456310","url":"/styles/20250/toodleo-convert-tabs-to-plane-list-in-right-column","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"toodledo.com\") {\r\n\r\n#tabs {\r\nheight:auto !important;\r\nwidth: 20%;\r\noverflow:hidden !important;\r\nposition:absolute;\r\nright:-25%;\r\ntop:30px;\r\nbackground-image:none !important;\r\nborder-left: 1px solid black;\r\n\r\n}\r\n.tab, .tabon  {\r\nfloat:none !important;\r\nbackground-image:none !important;\r\nmargin:0px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n#moretabs, .tl {\r\ndisplay:none;\r\n}\r\n#main {\r\nmargin-right:20%  !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}
