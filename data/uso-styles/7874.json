The latter effect is achieved on the site using Javascript, which cannot be selectively disabled (i.e if you disable Javascript in your browser you'll lose not be able to see stuff like like the site menu, which is also created using JavaScript). Therefore, this style hack simply hides the dynamically created DIVs that contain the image so the effect is not visible.","user":{"id":11091,"name":"ePVbdI","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-06-10T12:30:55.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":155,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/7874-after.png?r=1592726870","url":"/styles/7874/reinstate-normal-cursor-hide-animated-fencer","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"londonfencingclub.co.uk\") {\r\n    body,p,td,input,select,textarea, .sword{\r\n       cursor:default;\r\n    }\r\n    #CUR0, #CUR1, #CUR2, #CUR3, #CUR4{\r\n       display:none;\r\n    }\r\n}"}
