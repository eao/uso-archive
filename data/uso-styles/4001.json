{"id":4001,"name":"LiveJournal - Entry Box Width Tweak","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"livejournal","subcategory":"livejournal","style_tags":[],"description":"I don't know about anybody else, but for me 800px (max width of the box) is not enough and there's a lot of wasted space left on the right side. \r\nThis could be useful for HDTV/Widescreen monitors owners.\r\n\r\nP.S.: forgot to mention that it changes width on both \"Edit Entry\" & \"Update\" pages. If you want it to take effect on only one of those pages, just change: '@-moz-document domain(\"www.livejournal.com\")'  to '@-moz-document url(\"http://www.livejournal.com/update.bml\")' or '@-moz-document url(\"http://www.livejournal.com/editjournal.bml*\")' accordingly.
