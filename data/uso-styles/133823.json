After noticing that many of the sites I use regularly didn't have any dark styles (or any styles at all for that matter), I decided to upload my own for any other sufferers (or just anyone else who likes a darker look) to use. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am in no way an expert. I am aware that most of my styles are far from perfect, but they work for what I use them for. I learned a lot of what I know from just looking at other people's styles I've used in the past; as such, everyone is welcome to make whatever changes are needed to my styles to suit their own usage/tastes (if you need help, just ask).\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who has contributed to this great utility, and eternal thanks to Stylish for being exactly what lets me enjoy the web!\r\n\r\nPS. I use the FT DeepDark theme and styles for Firefox by Steva/Sr21, so my dark color scheme is similar to that (although I make mine a touch darker). If you want different colors, everything should be easily changeable.","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2016-10-15T09:56:14.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":22,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/133823_after.jpeg?r=1554105673","url":"/styles/133823/sl-maps-slurl-com-dark-nova","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"slurl.com\") {\r\n\r\nhtml, body, div.gmnoprint:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(1), div.gmnoprint:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(2)\r\n{color: #919191 !important;\r\nbackground: #1A1A1A !important;\r\nborder: none !important;}\r\n  \r\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6\r\n{color: #919191 !important;}    \r\n  \r\na\r\n{color: #00adee !important;}\r\n\r\na:visited \r\n{color: #00668c !important;} \r\n\r\n#foot, #head, .gm-style > div:nth-child(2), .gmnoprint:nth-child(4), div.gmnoprint:nth-child(6), #balloon-content > p:nth-child(4) > a:nth-child(1) > img:nth-child(1), .gm-style-mtc, .gm-svpc \r\n{display: none !important;} \r\n  \r\n#content \r\n{border: none !important;}\r\n  \r\n.gm-style > div:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(4) > div:nth-child(4) > div:nth-child(2) > div:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(4)\r\n{color: #919191 !important;\r\nbackground: #222 !important;\r\nborder: 1px solid #00adee !important;}\r\n  \r\n.gm-style > div:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(4) > div:nth-child(4) > div:nth-child(2) > div:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(3) > div:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(1), .gm-style > div:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(4) > div:nth-child(4) > div:nth-child(2) > div:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(3) > div:nth-child(2) > div:nth-child(1)\r\n{background: #222 !important;}\r\n\r\n}"}
