If you want to remove a tweak you can delete it from the style's CSS code - each tweak is commented so it shouldn't be too hard.\r\n\r\n<h1>List of tweaks</h1>\r\n<h2>Improved visibility of note and repeat icons</h2>\r\nThe note and repeat icons on anime lists are white with drop shadow, but when displayed on anime cards that have white or off-white backgrounds they are barely visible.  This tweak adds additional drop shadow to make them stand out more.\r\n\r\n<h2>Increased size of favorite thumbnails</h2>\r\nThe favorites page on profiles displays very small thumbnails with a lot of space between them and has 11 entries per row at the largest media breakpoint (1550px width+).  This tweak increases their size and displays 10 entries per row at the largest media breakpoint.\r\n\r\n<h2>Increased size of smiley face ratings</h2>\r\nThe smiley face ratings on anime lists are kind of small.  This increases their size to make them more visible.\r\n\r\n<h2>Colored smiley face ratings</h2>\r\nThis colors smiley face ratings on anime lists for clarity.  Smile is green, meh is orange, and frown is red.\r\n\r\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\r\n<h2>v1.0</h2>\r\n- Initial release","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"anilist.co\") {\r\n/* Increase size of favourite icons on profile favourites page, display 10 per row at final media breakpoint. */\r\n.favourites > .favourites-wrap {\r\n  grid-gap: 20px;\r\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 100px);\r\n  padding: 25px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.favourites-wrap > .favourite {\r\n  height: 160px;\r\n  width: 110px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Improve visibility of rewatch and note icons on anime lists */\r\n.medialist.cards .entry-card .notes, .medialist.cards .entry-card .repeat {\r\n    color: rgba(var(--color-white), 0.9);\r\n    filter: drop-shadow(0 0 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)) drop-shadow(1px 1px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Larger smile icons on anime lists */\r\nsvg[data-icon=\"smile\"], svg[data-icon=\"meh\"], svg[data-icon=\"frown\"] {\r\n    font-size: 1.6em;\r\n    margin-bottom: -1px; /* slight alignment tweak */\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Colored smile icons on anime lists */\r\nsvg[data-icon=\"smile\"] {\r\n    color: rgba(var(--color-orange), 1);\r\n} \r\n\r\nsvg[data-icon=\"meh\"] {\r\n    color: rgba(var(--color-orange), 1);\r\n} \r\n\r\nsvg[data-icon=\"frown\"] {\r\n    color: rgba(var(--color-red), 1);\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/183687/mator-s-anilist-style-tweaks.user.js","style_settings":[]}
