{"id":81800,"name":"Thai Font Substitution to Leelawadee","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"style_tags":[],"description":"Substitute following fonts to Leelawadee font. \r\n\r\n- Cordia New\r\n- MS Sans Serif & Microsoft Sans Serif\r\n- AngsanaUPC & Angsana New\r\n- CordiaUPC & Cordia New\r\n- Tahoma\r\n\r\nNote: Leelawadee is Thai UI font on Microsoft Windows Vista/7/8 and onward. It optimized for on-screen display and works well with ClearType. For Thai contents, IMHO, it looks better and easy to the eyes than Tahoma.\r\n\r\nNote 2: Due to image scaling, the screenshot on the left is not shown accurately. Please click on the image to see a proper sized image.\r\n\r\nNote 3: For Windows 10, there is a new font named Leelawadee UI which improve clarity for both regular and bold font. You can edit CSS source from Leelawadee to Leelawadee UI yourself.
