I removed the label and instead coloured the 'spoiler' entries red, so it's still easy to distinguish spoilers from non spoilers.","user":{"id":3571,"name":"V-smund","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2007-08-02T03:02:25.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":392,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/3075_after.png?r=1588925024","url":"/styles/3075/remove-spoilers-label-from-faqs","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"imdb.com\") {\r\n\r\n.spoiler {  background-image: none !important;\r\n            border: none !important;}\r\n\r\n.spoiler span {visibility: visible !important;\r\n               color:red !important;}\r\n\r\n}"}
