Also makes them semi-transparent until hovered over so they're less obtrusive. Similar to the Default Collapsed Drawers style, except the other style causes food not to show up on the Stable page.","user":{"id":518210,"name":"sonnet73","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2017-11-10T03:46:28.000Z","weekly_install_count":6,"total_install_count":618,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/148949_after.png?r=1597392545","url":"/styles/148949/habitica-collapse-drawers-until-hover","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"habitica.com\")\r\n{\r\n  .drawer-container:not(:hover)\r\n  {\r\n    opacity: 0.5;\r\n    height: 34px;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .drawer-container\r\n  {\r\n    transition: opacity 0.75s;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .drawer-container .popover\r\n  {\r\n    pointer-events: none;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .drawer-toggle-icon\r\n  {\r\n    display: none;\r\n  }\r\n}"}
