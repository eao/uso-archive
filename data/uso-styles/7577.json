{"id":7577,"name":"Hide Back/Forward Buttons When not Needed","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","style_tags":[],"description":"Automatically hides either the back or forward buttons (Or Both!) based on your current navigation of the page.   \r\n-If you cannot move back, the back button is removed.  \r\n-If you can't move forward, the foreward button is hidden.\r\n-If you are on a new tab or window, BOTH buttons are removed! (and so is the dropmarker button)\r\n\r\n* Thanks to user 1185 and user 1158 for their Back/Forward hiding styles - Where I got the idea.\r\n\r\nGives you a larger area, and more screenspace for your browser...They only display when required!  \r\nWorks for both Firefox 3 and Firefox 2.\r\nWhy install an extension to do this, when you can do it through CSS!?\r\n\r\nUnified Back/Forward buttons that only appear when you need them (nothing to go to).  Visually notifies you if you have a page to navigate to by enabling the button!\r\n\r\nWorks great with the Back Is Close Firefox Extension!\r\n\r\nIntegrates with Style 7174, and Style 7575, allowing you to remove the RSS Icon, the Bookmark favorite icon, and the Home toolbar Button.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.2:\r\n+ Added code to also hide the DropMarker if BOTH the Back and Forward buttons are disabled (new tab)\r\n\r\n1.0.0.1:\r\n+ Added Namespace so that the style only applies to the App User Interface.","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-07-30T12:33:45.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":3346,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/7577_after.png?r=1593590742","url":"/styles/7577/hide-back-forward-buttons-when-not-needed","discussionsCount":3,"commentsCount":3,"css":"/*\r\n___________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                               |\r\n|          Title:  |  Hide Back/Forward Buttons when not needed    |\r\n|    Description:  |  Hidden if you cannot navigate forward or back|\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-                                      |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  May 27, 2008                                 |\r\n|   Date Updated:  |  July 30, 2008                                |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.2                                      |\r\n|__________________|_______________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(\"http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul\");\r\n\r\n\r\n/* Back */\r\n#back-button[disabled=\"true\"] \r\n{ \r\n  display: none; \r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/* Forward button */\r\n#forward-button[disabled=\"true\"] \r\n{ \r\n  display: none; \r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/* \r\nDropmarker - List of Forward/Back URLS\r\n  Will disable if both back and forward are disabled: \r\n*/\r\n#back-forward-dropmarker[disabled=\"true\"]\r\n{\r\n  display: none; \r\n}"}
