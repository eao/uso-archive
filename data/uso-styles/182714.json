  "name": "Google - Fix menu accessibility",
  "description": "Early april, google changed some parameters in its stylesheet. Since then, when accessing the \"Settings\" menu on google search homepage, some of the items can be unclickable depending on the size of the window.\r\nIt's due to the fact that in html the form is taking the whole width of the page and is displayed over the menu.\r\nIn the screenshot I've set a red background, partially transparent, to the form. You can see that it overlaps the menu (opaque yellow background).\r\nWhen this fix is applied, the menu is displayed in front and is clickable.\r\n\r\nFor more styles, userscripts, extensions, tips, ..., go to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://users.skynet.be/alternity/programming/\">http://users.skynet.be/alternity/programming/</a>",
