This style will remove most features from practice mode so you can make real progress.\r\n\r\n- Removes progress bar (So you are not constantly looking at it, and becoming frustated when it goes back when you make a mistake)\r\n\r\n- Removes the excercise title (It is pretty obvious what you have to do in each exercise once you have used Duolingo for a while)\r\n\r\n- Removes the hints!!!
