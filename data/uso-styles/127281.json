Let's call it Shitbook. Sadly some people insist upon using Shitbook, which means we must log-in to the SHIT to message them.\r\n\r\nThis user-style will <b><u>HIDE ALL</u> of the posts</b> <u>in the Facebook (Shitbook) news feed</u>. <i>The collective <b>timeline</b> (best of and most recent posts regarding friends or people you follow) is <b>hidden</b>.</i> This allows you to use the chat/message function without being distracted by all the shit people post to the news-feed timeline.\r\n\r\nInstead of posts in the news feed you just see a blank space. Lovely! Fuck off Mark Zuckerberg, I hate you!\r\n\r\nI have no idea if people will like or use this style, but here is it nevertheless.\r\n\r\nCrippled Shitbook functionality, via this style, will remind you to either not log-in or log-out sooner rather than later.","user":{"id":264740,"name":"SingularityUtopia","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":"<br>\r\nI'm a superlative mind-explosion expert interested in artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nYou can follow me via Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=@2045singularity\" target=\"_blank\">@2045singularity</a>; <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+SingularityUtopia/posts\" target=\"_blank\">or Google+</a>.\r\n \r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=2045singularity\" target=\"_blank\">Tweet something to me</a> if you desire.\r\n\r\nNote also my <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+Singularity-2045/posts\">G+ Singularity 2045</a> page regarding the latest news about radical science and technology.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://userstyles.org/users/283355\">Transhumanity</a> is my alternate Stylish profile where I publish my less important userstyles. \r\n\r\n<br>","license":"ccby"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2016-04-29T08:01:16.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":168,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/127281_after.png?r=1590307412","url":"/styles/127281/hide-facebook-news-feed-timeline-posts","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix('http://www.facebook.' ) , url-prefix('https://www.facebook.' ) , url-prefix('http://facebook.' ) , url-prefix('https://facebook.' )\r\n\r\n\r\n{\r\n\r\n#stream_pagelet\r\n\r\n  {\r\n     display: none !important; \r\n  }\r\n\r\n}"}
