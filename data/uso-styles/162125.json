This means that they can force you to use Google's emoji style, which most people hate. \r\n\r\nThis script disables the image emoji and shows the text emoji instead. If you have a proper emoji supporting font installed, you will see that font's emoji instead. In the screenshot, the Twemoji font is pictured.\r\n\r\nOnly tested on hangouts.google.com, but you might get it to work on other hangouts supporting sites.","user":{"id":382149,"name":"Adam Fontenot","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbysa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2018-07-04T00:35:56.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":15,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/162125_after.jpeg?r=1596528404","url":"/styles/162125/force-hangouts-desktop-app-to-use-text-emoji","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain('hangouts.google.com') {\r\n    span[data-emo] > div {\r\n        display: none !important;\r\n    }\r\n    span[data-emo] > span {\r\n        opacity: unset !important;\r\n        width: 1em !important;\r\n        height: 1em !important;\r\n        position: unset !important;\r\n        font-family: \"twemoji, sans-serif\";\r\n        font-size: 22px; /* use this to tweak emoji size */\r\n    }\r\n    button > span[data-emo] > span {\r\n        font-size: 22px;\r\n        width: 22px !important;\r\n    }\r\n}"}
