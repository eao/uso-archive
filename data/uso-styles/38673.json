I don't maximize my browser, but I often snap it to the side of the screen, and the resultant horizontal scrollbar in Twitter bothers me. This style alters the layout slightly to fit into a 940px-wide window.","user":{"id":6424,"name":"sethaurus","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"spam@ironi.st","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2010-10-20T04:34:19.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":551,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/38673-after.png?r=1597219565","url":"/styles/38673/twitter-collapse-layout-width-to-940px","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"twitter.com\") {\r\n\t/* Reduce the left-hand margin */\r\n\t#page-container {\r\n\t\tmargin: 4px;\r\n\t}\r\n\t/* Allow header and columns to squeeze tighter */\r\n\t#page-outer, #top-bar {\r\n\t\tmin-width: 0px;\r\n\t}\r\n\t/* Shift the profile link left from the scrollbar */\r\n\t#top-bar .active-links {\r\n\t\tright: 40px;\r\n\t}\r\n}"}
