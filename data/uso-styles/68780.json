This saves enough screen space that single-line\r\n *               layouts of the manager are easy. For such an example, I\r\n *               suggest trying the \"Firefox Addons Manager Table Layout\"\r\n *               style by \"bernstein\" at userstyles.org.\r\n *                  http://userstyles.org/styles/67076/firefox-addons-manager-table-layout\r\n *               (Icons Only as originally designed as a suppliment to that style)\r\n *  ==/UserStyle==\r\n *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    /* fortunately, XUL stores the icon and text as separate DOM nodes,\r\n       which makes this really easy */\r\n    #addon-list .control-container .addon-control .button-text  {\r\n        display: none !important;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* the icon usually has a bit of a margin set, presumably to keep\r\n       the text from getting to close to it */\r\n    #addon-list .control-container .addon-control .button-icon {\r\n        margin-right: 0px !important;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* min-width is usually set to >6em which assumes you have text */\r\n    /* cleanup the outer margins, too, so the buttons sit closer together */\r\n    #addon-list .control-container .addon-control {\r\n        min-width:    2em !important;\r\n        margin-left:  1px !important;\r\n        margin-right: 1px !important;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* stylish's own edit buttons don't have an icon, which makes them blank\r\n       without the text, so here we'll force them to have a standard stock icon */\r\n    #addon-list .control-container .addon-control[label=\"Edit\"] .button-icon {\r\n        list-style-image: url(\"moz-icon://stock/gtk-edit?size=button\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n"}
