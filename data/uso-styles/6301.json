{"id":6301,"name":"Zap2it - cleaned and resized","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"zap2it","subcategory":"zap2it","style_tags":[],"description":"I knew practically nothing about CSS before last month, then Zap2it pushed me over the edge by forcing me to see ABC's listings (which is not in my favorites) at the top of the grid - with an irritating background image included. Anyway, this style sheet gives a more usable 6-hour grid by increasing the width and removing the rest of the stuff that I don't use and don't want.\r\n\r\nSee the comments in the code for more information.\r\n\r\nAlso note, I've been using Firefox 1.5 until a few months ago (Dec. '08) and it correctly displayed the sizes of boxes in the grid. Then I upgraded to version 3.04 and the boxes for different stations vary in size, leading to them not line up properly with the grid times. I have yet to investigate to see if newer versions of Firefox fix this problem, but I have been using this style sheet in Opera (9.5 beta) instead as it works properly. (Update June '10: using Firefox 3.6 now and they're displayed properly again.)","user":{"id":7562,"name":"eupeptic","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2011-06-05T00:33:45.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1393,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/6301_after.gif?r=1586246499","url":"/styles/6301/zap2it-cleaned-and-resized","discussionsCount":3,"commentsCount":3,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"zap2it.com\"){\r\n/* This line removed ABC's forced favorite. */\r\n/* .zc-row-odd#zc-station-10479 { display: none; } */\r\n\r\n/* Removes NBC's forced favorite and the title (but not the image - use hosts, an ad blocker, or\r\n * disable JavaScript) for their pop-up ad.\r\n * #zc-st-20451 { display: none; }\r\n * .zc-icad-c { display: none; } */\r\n\r\n/* Removes HGTV's forced favorite.\r\n * #zc-st-14902 { display: none; }\r\n * #zc-ss-pos-14902 { display: none; } */\r\n\r\n/* Removes ABC's forced favorite. */\r\n#zc-ss-pos-19574 { display: none; }\r\n.zc-row.zc-station-position.zc-station-watermark { display: none; }\r\n\r\n/* Removes header, footer, and ads. */\r\n#header { display: none; }\r\n#logostrip { display: none; }\r\n#aff_rightbar { display: none; }\r\n#aff_footer { display: none; }\r\niframe { display: none; }\r\n.wrapperTop { display: none; }\r\n.wrapperLeft { display: none; }\r\n#zc-topbar-leaderboard { display: none; }\r\n#zc-ss-pos-20451 { display: none; }\r\n.zc-station-position { display: none; }\r\n\r\n/* Resizes the grid (note the 13:1 ratio between the width of the full grid and the program width,\r\n * and the station width (zc-st) can be fine-tuned if necessary to help line up the left side of\r\n * the program times with the program grid). */\r\n#zc-wrapper-inner { width: 1001px !important; }\r\n.zc-st { width: 60px !important; }\r\n.zc-tn-t { width: 77px !important; }\r\n.wrapperRight { display: none; }\r\n}"}
