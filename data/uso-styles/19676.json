So it may(!) apply for more pages on the web.\r\n- Distorts the rest of the design a little bit.\r\n- Has impact on Wikipedia and GMX too, sadly. They use the same div-names. Just deactivate the style, when not using GA.","user":{"id":5174,"name":"lestarte2008","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-07-21T13:48:49.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":312,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/19676_after.gif?r=1589529796","url":"/styles/19676/google-analytics-show-longer-pagenames-hack","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n/* (c) 2009 by Lestarte */\r\n\r\nobject[data*=\"content\"],\r\n\r\ntd [class=\"text\"], div [class=\"text_wrapper\"], a {\r\n  width:500px !important;\r\n  overflow:visible;\r\n}\r\n"}
