You can use any value you like, and a value of 0 pixels would display no signature - though there is an in-built forum function for that and another script of mine, too.","user":{"id":6742,"name":"bitpicker","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"robinpfeifer@web.de","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-06-18T02:10:07.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":165,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/8064-after.png?r=1589616214","url":"/styles/8064/about-com-disable-signature-chop-off","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/* about.com Disable Signature Chop-Off 0.1 */\r\n\r\n/* This short script disables the signature size restriction\r\n   of 500 pixels vertical. */\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"forums.about.com\") {\r\n\r\ntd.pfMsgBody div.pfMsgSig\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tmax-height:none !important;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}"}
