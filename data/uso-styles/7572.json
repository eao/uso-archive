The throbber is the small circular clickable area on the top-right corner of your browser that animates when a page is loading. Gives you a larger area, and more screenspace for your browser.  Works for both Firefox 3 and Firefox 2.\r\n\r\n** Idea came from user 1's style 469.  Thanks Jason!\r\n\r\nIntegrates with Style 7174, and Style 7169, allowing you to remove the RSS Icon, the Bookmark favorite icon, and the Go Button.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n- Initial Release","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-05-27T09:11:49.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":684,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/7572_after.png?r=1580371267","url":"/styles/7572/remove-hide-the-throbber-button","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"css":"/*\r\n___________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                               |\r\n|          Title:  |  Remove (Hide) the Throbber Button            |\r\n|    Description:  |  Hides the throbber from loading main toolbar |\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-                                      |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  May 27, 2008                                 |\r\n|   Date Updated:  |  May 27, 2008                                 |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.0                                      |\r\n|__________________|_______________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(\"http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul\");\r\n\r\n#throbber-box \r\n{\r\n  display: none !important; \r\n}"}
