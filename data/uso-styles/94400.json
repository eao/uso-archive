Those are the boxes that say \"Advertisement\" under them. As an Amazon Prime member who buys a great deal of things exclusively through Amazon, I got tired of seeing flashy ads on every page when all I wanted to do was find and buy something. This style does not remove ads for Amazon's own services, such as ads for items for sale or the Amazon credit card.","user":{"id":235628,"name":"michaelday","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2013-10-23T10:45:11.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":920,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/94400-after.png?r=1592813378","url":"/styles/94400/remove-external-ads-on-amazon","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"amazon.com\") {\r\n#navbar.nav-beacon #welcomeRowTable {\r\n\tdisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#nav_sitewide_msg_4192_primary {\r\n\tdisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nobject.adNoOutline {\r\n\tdisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#leftNavAdvertising {\r\n\tdisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#DAr2 {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n  \r\n#DAr7 {\r\n\tdisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n  \r\niframe {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}
