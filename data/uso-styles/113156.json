Great for huge monitors or widescreen TVs. I have a 3200x1080 desktop, so I hated the fact that all my search results only occupied the 15% of the left side of the screen while the rest lay unused on the right* The style in the preview is combined with \"Darker Google\" by Zigboom Designs.","user":{"id":87204,"name":"osirisgothra","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"osirisgothra@hotmail.com","homepage":"http://www.github.com/osirisgothra","about":"Gabriel Sharp\r\n\r\nI consider myself a lifetime student of Computer Sciences and Information Sciences, as the time for learning is never over, especially when working in a field that deals with envelopes that are ever-changing, pushing endlessly, so to speak. My work and play cross paths often since I get a lot of joy out of what I do and study, some of which are:\r\n\r\n- Perl + CPAN Developer\r\n- Linux C++ Developer (Qt4, Qt5, KDE4, KFM5, and related)\r\n- Shell Script Developer (Perl, BASH, sh, upstart, vim plugin development)\r\n- Web Style Developer (CSS, SaSS, SGML, HTML5, etc) though I do know HTML4 too [who doesn't?]\r\n- Windows C++ Developer (Old Pro in Microsoft related technologies)\r\n- Old-School Technologies (qbasic, vbdos, borland c++, ms-dos 6.66, i386 assembler /w emphasis on _some_ 64-bit stuff)\r\n- Music Hobbyist (Electronic Music Writer, Piano, Keyboard player/Enthusiast)\r\n- Graphic Artist (Pencil/Pen/Watercolor physical media, Maya/Blender/3DSMax/Bryce/Gimp/Photoshop HD and post-production)\r\n\r\nI am not currently in any group at the time. I am not sure if I will be doing that ever again. The last few groups I participated in were too incoherent and seemed to have different ideals, ethics, goals. \r\n\r\nI am open to suggestion or requests, just don't make them impossible for a single person to do. Requesting a theme have a black version is probably okay. Requesting that I personally show up and restyle your entire website is probably not. Of course, if I were getting paid to do it, that would be a whole other matter, but I rarely see people paying for such things these days when you can hire someone in another country to do it for 2 cents -- that's right I'm a bitter man :D= <- those are vampire teeth!!","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2015-04-29T03:16:37.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":317,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/113156_after.jpeg?r=1588147495","url":"/styles/113156/multi-column-spanning-widescreen-google-results","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"google.com\") {\r\n      \r\n   \r\n    .mw\r\n    {\r\n        display: -moz-grid !important;\r\n        width: 100% !important;\r\n        max-width: 100% !important;\r\n    }\r\n/* not working?
