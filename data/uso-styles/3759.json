Please place you're ads in a less jarring location, so it doesn't interrupt the content. :) Thanks. To use this you need also the firefox adblock add-on. This style will increase the size of the content area, hide the breadcrumb, as well as shift the content so it aligns flush left. I am also rocking the Firefox Nasa theme, if you wanted to know.","user":{"id":4396,"name":"braydonfuller","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2007-10-10T19:27:31.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":89,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/3759_after.png?r=1475410022","url":"/styles/3759/fsdaily-com","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(fsdaily.com) {\r\n  .news-summary {left:-175px; width:125%;}\r\n  #wrap2 {left:0px;}\r\n  #breadcrumbs {display:none;}\r\n}"}
