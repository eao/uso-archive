{"id":84844,"name":"Simple workflowy in bold monospace: light","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"workflowy","subcategory":"workflowy","style_tags":[],"description":"This style makes the text in workflowy bold and monospace. It also removes the horizontal scrollbar.\r\n\r\nWithin workflowy's settings, I personally use this with the \"Wood\" theme and \"Light\" font.\r\n\r\nWhy do I use \"Light\" font, not Wood's \"Typewriter\" font, which is also monospace?\r\n\r\nI like \"Typewriter\", but it isn't that visible on the iPhone, where I have no way to bold it. So I use the \"Light\" font on iPhone, but that switches the font on the web app too to \"Light\" too, which I don't want. So I created this theme because it gives you the option to have a different font selected on your iPhone or iPad than you see in your web app.","user":{"id":181597,"name":"Christoph Dollis","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://ChristophDollis.com/","about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2013-03-24T21:43:08.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":777,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/84844_after.png?r=1595750981","url":"/styles/84844/simple-workflowy-in-bold-monospace-light","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/*\r\nSimple workflowy in bold monospace: light\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain('workflowy.com'), {\r\n\r\n\r\nbody, page-container {\r\nfont-weight: bold;\r\nfont-family: courier, courier new, monospace !important;\r\noverflow-y: scroll;\r\noverflow-x: hidden !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n}"}
