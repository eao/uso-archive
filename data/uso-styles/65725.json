This style lengthens that text box to roughly the size of the image, makes the font slightly smaller and turns it black for readability.","user":{"id":134684,"name":"Sosarian","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2012-05-16T02:13:27.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":67,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/65725_after.jpeg?r=1589270581","url":"/styles/65725/slate-slideshow-larger-description-area","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.slate.com/slideshows/\") {\r\n\r\n/* Make the text box bigger */\r\n/* Margin-top controls how high on the page it begins (can be negative)*/\r\n\r\n.slide-content-wrapper, .slide-content {\r\n  height: 450px !important;\r\n  margin-top: 40px !important;\r\n  width: 350px !important;\r\n  margin-right: 0px !important;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n/* Put text closer to image; \r\nlower (more negative) makes it go left\r\nhigher (less negative) makes it go right */\r\n.sl-right-rail {\r\n  margin-left:-10px !important;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n\r\n/* Which font type (Slate default=serif), color and size */\r\n.content p {\r\n  color:black !important;\r\n  font-family: serif !important;\r\n  font-size: 1em !important;\r\n  line-height: 1.2em !important;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}"}
