It also makes all the images display as a block element, which makes each image take a new line and results in less problems when multiple images are close together.\r\n\r\nDefault size is set to a max width of 700px, changing this digit is optional.\r\n\r\n- Fixed emoticons from being block elements.","user":{"id":17865,"name":"aka hateradio","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-11-11T21:08:45.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":2738,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/14636-after.png?r=1587542683","url":"/styles/14636/neogaf-post-image-re-size-hover","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":4,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.neogaf.com\") {\r\n\r\n/* IMG +ROLL */\r\n\r\ndiv[id^=\"post_message_\"] img:not(.inlineimg) {\r\nmax-width: 700px;\r\ncursor: pointer;\r\ndisplay:block\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiv[id^=\"post_message_\"] img:not(.inlineimg):hover {\r\nmax-width: 100000px;\r\ndisplay:block\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*END*/ }"}
