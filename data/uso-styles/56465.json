{"id":56465,"name":"Firefox 9 - Restore left border on reload button","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","style_tags":[],"description":"This style restores the border between the reload button and the drop-down arrow for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It feels sloppy and confusing to not have the drop-down arrow the right-most thing in a combobox and the awesomebar is intuitively understood to be a very fancy combobox.\r\n\r\n2. All the icons within the awesomebar are what Chrome refers to as \"page actions\". To me, the reload button feels more like a \"browser action\", which means it should be visually distinct. (That's also why I use the \"RSS Icon\" extension rather than the toolbar button)\r\n\r\nMore details on my rationale on my blog. http://blog.ssokolow.com/archives/2011/11/16/how-and-why-to-bring-back-the-border-on-the-firefox-8-reload-button/","user":{"id":17680,"name":"ssokolow","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"from_paypal@ssokolow.com","homepage":"http://www.ssokolow.com/","about":"<strong>Userstyles.org has a bug which keeps resetting my notification e-mail address.
