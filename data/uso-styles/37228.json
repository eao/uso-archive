There were just a few things that bothered me, which I described here:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/fjordaan/4731650184/in/set-465611/ This stylesheet items 2 and 4 on my list:\r\n\r\n(1) Reinstate title above photo\r\n(2) Keep the 'photostream' film strip permanently open. (It's currently hidden when you come from a different context, such as Contacts or Favorites.)\r\n\r\nSee also my stylesheet for reinstating the button bar: style 37282\r\n\r\nReport any issues on the Flickr photo page or Flickr Hacks thread:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/fjordaan/5024220354/\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/groups/flickrhacks/discuss/72157625032814264/","user":{"id":63086,"name":"fjordaan","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://www.isotoma.com","about":"UX director at www.isotoma.com\r\nTweeting @fjordaan","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2010-09-27T02:48:26.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":412,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/37228_after.png?r=1589184326","url":"/styles/37228/flickr-title-above-photo-expand-photostream","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.flickr.com\") {\r\n/* MOVE TITLE ABOVE PHOTO */\r\nh1.photo-title {\r\nposition: absolute;\r\ntop: 36px;\r\nmax-width: 640px;\r\nbackground: #fff;\r\n}\r\nh1.photo-title:hover {\r\nbackground: transparent;\r\n}\r\nh1.photo-title.insitu-editing {\r\nz-index: 999;\r\n}\r\n#photo {\r\nmargin-top: 49px !important;\r\nmargin-bottom: 10px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* PERMANENTLY EXPAND PHOTOSTREAM FILM STRIP */\r\n.sidebar-context-first .context-photos {\r\ndisplay: block !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}
