Anything that require a premium membership will be hidden, deleted from the site. From buttons in 720P, 1080P, to log-ins, sign-ups, banners, menus, links and more.

I like various anime in the style of Dragon Ball Z, Bleach & Sword Art Online. I love spicy food & vanilla stuff! Also I'm a web stylist. I started off on a community website called Gaia Online with CSS and CSS3 style language. I continued working on websites and designs and now here I am. I am trying to make a living on making websites and web styles like theses. I do not force anyone on donating, but it is most appreciated. ♥","license":"ccbyncnd"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2017-10-03T04:04:32.000Z","weekly_install_count":5,"total_install_count":517,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/149078_after.jpeg?r=1597392577","url":"/styles/149078/crunchyroll-depremiumize-premium-removal","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"www.crunchyroll.com\") {\r\n\r\n#slidebox, \r\n#adblocker_message, \r\n#header_container .premium, \r\n#showmedia_free_trial_signup, \r\n#sidebar a[href*='freetrial'], \r\n.video-quality [title='720P'], \r\n.video-quality [title='1080P'], \r\n.video-quality a[href*='noads'], \r\n#header_menubar_beta li a[href*='freetrial'], \r\n.user-profile-personal-info tr:nth-child(1), \r\n#allCommentsList img[title='Premium Member'], \r\n.user-profile-box img[title='Premium Member'], \r\n#user_profile_links a[href*='freetrial'] { \r\ndisplay: none !important; \r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
