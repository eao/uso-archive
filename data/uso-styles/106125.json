If I'm able to find a way to hide the \"People you may know\" element without causing those other entries to be affected, I'll update this Style accordingly and update this announcement indicating that I've done so.","user":{"id":275490,"name":"Atypical Male","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2014-10-09T01:17:19.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":969,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/106125_after.jpeg?r=1588752331","url":"/styles/106125/facebook-hide-people-you-may-know-in-news-feed","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n/* This style hides the \"People you may know\" section which appears in the News Feed of Facebook. */\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"facebook.com\") { ._2ph_ {display: none !important;} }"}
