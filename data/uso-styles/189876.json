{"id":189876,"name":"Roblox Old Halloween Logo","description":"Feel like your playing some (almost) old skool Roblox in October with this logo change. Changes the Roblox logo into the old BloxTober logo, and makes the Tilted block the classic R, but orange! Id recommend to use the Dark theme, as the orange looks better in the dark. Maybe in the future ill make the actual website background fall themed.\r\n\r\n(The extension I use is BTRoblox, fyi.)","user":{"id":1035690,"name":"TankGuy827","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2020-09-26T00:06:50.000Z","weekly_install_count":20,"total_install_count":20,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/189876_after.png?r=1601366643","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/189876_additional_37104.png?r=1601366643","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/189876_additional_37105.png?r=1601366643"],"license":"publicdomain","created":"2020-09-25T23:55:08.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"roblox","subcategory":"roblox","additional_info":"9/25/2020 8:06 PM: Fixed the orange R logo","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"roblox.com\") {\r\n/* BloxTober Logo */\r\n.icon-logo,\r\n.light-theme .icon-logo,\r\n.dark-theme .icon-logo {\r\n    background-image: url(\"https://i.ibb.co/zQKBnWL/Adobe-20200925-180329.png\");\r\n}\r\n.icon-logo-r,\r\n.light-theme .icon-logo-r,\r\n.dark-theme .icon-logo-r,\r\n.icon-logo-r-95,\r\n.light-theme .icon-logo-r-95,\r\n.dark-theme .icon-logo-r-95 {\r\n    background-image: url(\"https://i.ibb.co/dfJfbz6/orangeroblox-R-removebg-preview.png\");\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/189876/roblox-old-halloween-logo.user.js","style_settings":[]}
