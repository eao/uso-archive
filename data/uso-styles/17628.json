I have removed the dropdown marker and adjusted the margins as well. This is mainly intended for those who have it placed next to their throbber, like in my screenshot.\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\n\r\nJul 26 2009 - Fixed an issue with the way FF 3.5 handles opacity. Not sure if this works on 3 now, if not just add \"moz-\" before opacity and it should work.","user":{"id":22577,"name":"TtWEAK","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-07-26T09:23:48.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":159,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/17628_after.png?r=1562918475","url":"/styles/17628/update-notifier-less-visible-when-no-updates","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n/* REMOVE DROPDOWN MARKER */\r\n#un-toolbarbutton > dropmarker {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* ADJUST MARGINS */\r\n.un-icons {\r\n  margin: -1px 0px 0px 0px !important;\r\n  padding: 0px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* HALF-OPACITY WHEN NO UPDATES */\r\n.un-icons[icon=\"none\"] {\r\n opacity: 0.5 !important;\r\n}"}
