If there are any missing images on the list, please let me know.  One side effect is that the plain (TV) and unknown labels appear larger than before, this is to accommodate repositioning the show logo relative to the label.","user":{"id":12730,"name":"sparr","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbysa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2010-03-17T14:40:42.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":249,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/26315_after.png?r=1572940871","url":"/styles/26315/tvtorrents-reposition-resolution-audio-labels","discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"tvtorrents.com\") {\r\n  img[src=\"/images/unknown_51.png\"],\r\n  img[src=\"/images/720p_20.png\"],\r\n  img[src=\"/images/720p_51.png\"],\r\n  img[src=\"/images/tv_20.png\"] ,\r\n  img[src=\"/images/tv.png\"] {\r\n    position:relative !important;\r\n    top:0 !important;\r\n    left:0 !important;\r\n    height:27px !important;\r\n  }\r\n  tr.torrent_row td a img[width=\"100\"] {\r\n    position:relative;\r\n    top:-27px !important;\r\n    margin-bottom:-27px !important;\r\n  }\r\n}"}
