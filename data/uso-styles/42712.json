Note that this will change it on EVERY plurk timeline, not just your own. People will still be able to promote your plurks, and you can promote other people's plurks by temporarily turning off this style in Stylish.\r\nLast updated: 4/26/11","user":{"id":82310,"name":"haecvir","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2011-04-26T12:12:35.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":797,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/42712-after.png?r=1590221041","url":"/styles/42712/plurk-hide-promote-and-front-links","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.plurk.com\") {\r\na.promote.action { display: none !important;}\r\na.front { display: none;}\r\n}"}
