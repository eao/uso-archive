This new style incorporates/adjusts-to Google's June/July 2011 Calendar updates.  After applying this style, users will see the Google Search section disappear as well as the left-hand calendar tools.  \r\n\r\nSet you Calendar settings to \"Comfortable\".\r\n\r\n***NOTE*** Once this style is applied, you will NOT be able to change the colors of individual calendars, as these options are only accessible via the now-hidden, left-side panel.  Please set up your color schemes before enabling.  To make changes after enabling, please disable Stylish or unload this style.","user":{"id":43778,"name":"andrewkozak","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"andrew.kozak@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2014-12-30T03:22:24.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1471,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/50260-after.png?r=1590221041","url":"/styles/50260/google-calendar-full-screen-calendar","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.google.com/calendar/\"),url-prefix(\"https://www.google.com/calendar/\")\r\n{\r\n\r\n#nav { display: none; }\r\n#mainbody { margin: 0 8px !important; }\r\n#gridcontainer { width: 100%; }\r\n\r\n}"}
