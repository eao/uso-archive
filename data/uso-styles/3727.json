{"id":3727,"name":"dAmn no horizontal scrollbar","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"deviantart","subcategory":"deviantart","style_tags":[],"description":"This is a simple little CSS trick to keep the deviantART chat pages from popping up a horizontal scrollbar when someone stretches a word.  The scrollbar will appear if you hover over the chat area though, so you can still see things if you need to.  The vertical scrollbar remains in place no matter what, so you don't have to worry about that.  I also removed the scrollbar on the far right side of the page since that was just a waste of space.","user":{"id":2853,"name":"electricjonny","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbysa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2011-03-13T17:50:32.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":480,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":null,"url":"/styles/3727/damn-no-horizontal-scrollbar","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"chat.deviantart.com\") {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n.damncrc-chat-window {\r\n\tmax-width:100%;overflow-x:hidden!important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.damncrc-chat-window:hover {\r\n\toverflow:auto!important;\r\n} \r\n\r\nbody.fullscreen, body.fullscreen #body  {\r\n\toverflow:hidden!important;\r\n}"}
