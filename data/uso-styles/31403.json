This merely hides the \"'do not disturb' is on\" notice, since I always expect it to be on and it can be distracting from other messages Google Voice might be displaying in the same area.","user":{"id":2444,"name":"WCityMike","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2010-06-06T00:06:38.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":241,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":null,"url":"/styles/31403/google-voice-hide-do-not-disturb-notice","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.google.com/voice\"), url-prefix(\"https://www.google.com/voice\") {\r\n#gc-dnd-display, .gc-dnd-display\r\n{\r\ndisplay: none !important\r\n}\r\n}"}
