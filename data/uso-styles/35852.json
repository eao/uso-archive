The Sun-Times blog pages that host his writings are not exactly the most conducive to concentrating on his pieces. The Readability bookmark malfunctions on the page, so it's not an alternative.  Finally, I got fed up with it, and took a whack at simplifying the page.  I like the result, and hope you do as well.","user":{"id":2444,"name":"WCityMike","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2010-08-20T20:16:29.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":138,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/35852-after.png?r=1542528071","url":"/styles/35852/roger-ebert-just-his-great-writings","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/\") {\r\n.header, .smtext, #beta-inner, .globalnav, .searchbutton, #sixapart-standard > BODY > CENTER > TABLE > TBODY > TR:first-child > TD > TABLE > TBODY > TR, #header-inner, #beta, #gamma, .asset-meta, #sharethis_0, .footer\r\n{\r\ndisplay: none !important\r\n}\r\n\r\n#alpha\r\n{\r\nwidth: 100% !important\r\n}\r\n\r\nblockquote\r\n{\r\nmargin: 0 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nbody, .STNG_container\r\n{\r\nbackground-color: #FFFFFF !important\r\n}\r\n\r\n.STNG_container_border, .contentarea\r\n{\r\nborder: none !important\r\n}\r\n}"}
