Unless you're on a netbook, in which case the ad along the side takes up way too much screen space, making the interface hard to use.\r\n\r\nThis style removes that ad, and hides the stuff in the page footer. Wish Evernote would address the issue, or create a Linux client. Until then, this will have to do. Created, tested, and working as of 2010-07-07.\r\n\r\nTO DO:\r\n1) Decrease page margin whitespace, especially at bottom, but also on sides. Spent too much time on this already. If anybody can tell me the trick, I'll update the style.","user":{"id":14583,"name":"Dan Rasmussen","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"dan.rasmussen@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2010-07-07T22:33:10.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":592,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/33338-after.png?r=1587283394","url":"/styles/33338/evernote-screen-maximizer","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n/*\r\nEvernote screen real estate pursuer.\r\nDan Rasmussen (danrasmussen.org), 2010-07-07.\r\n*/\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"evernote.com\") {\r\n  div.SidebarInfo, div#footer {\r\n    display: none;\r\n  }\r\n}"}
