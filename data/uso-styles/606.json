{"id":606,"name":"ScrollButtons Change Color","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","style_tags":[],"description":"As of the latest 2.0a3 Nightly Branch Builds, you get arrows on either side of tabs, so multiple tabs can be \"scrolled.\"  Kinda cool.  However, I didnt' like the \"tiny transparent white\" markers - this is a \"dramatic color\" to show off the end button - but change to your liking.  I colorize active tab \"green\" and cut opacity on non-active; all I have to do now is make the arrow larger and I'll be set.  White arrow on black background would be cool . . . I'll work on it.","user":{"id":15,"name":"Paulfox","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2006-07-06T16:40:55.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":597,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/606_after.png?r=1580371267","url":"/styles/606/scrollbuttons-change-color","discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2,"css":"/*Coded by Paulfox July 7th 2006 Ver 1.0 */\r\n@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n.scrollbutton-up, .scrollbutton-down {background-color: #FF66FF !important; }"}
