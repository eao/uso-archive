Here I just set to DejaVu Sans Mono and Courier New.\r\n\r\nIn the future I'm *NOT* making it work over the very areas that showing multi-lined text but the whole Douban site.  Whenever you hate it, just turn OFF this style with your Stylish/GreaseMonkey button on the status-bar (if you leave the button there).","user":{"id":12783,"name":"Lam Edh","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-08-12T05:59:51.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":703,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/9243-after.png?r=1593418113","url":"/styles/9243/douban-fixed-width-font-for-programmers","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"douban.com\"), domain(\"douban.net\")\r\n{\r\n\r\n* {font-family: DejaVu Sans Mono, Courier New !important }\r\n\r\n}"}
