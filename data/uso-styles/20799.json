{"id":20799,"name":"extbook - autohide bookmark stars","category":"app","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"style_tags":[],"description":"Autohide the additional stars of add-on \"extbook\" (https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/10567) and recover by hovering the urlbar. I think that if you set up the stars once, you don't usually need to show the addstar-button, so I hide it. If you want it back, just comment out the appropriate lines.\r\nThere is one bug in my code: If you click the \"old\" star to edit your bookmark, the dialog window jumps somewhere. I don't know how to fix it. But if you use the library to edit, you shouldn't worry.\r\n\r\nHey, and watch my nice APNG-image ;-)\r\n\r\nIf you don't want the feed-button to jump around, add \"#feed-button {-moz-box-ordinal-group: 2 !important;}\". Have a look at style 20983 by me.","user":{"id":27559,"name":"YocQIzaPbv","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-09-15T14:24:54.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":251,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/20799_after.png?r=1576310479","url":"/styles/20799/extbook-autohide-bookmark-stars","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix('chrome://') {\r\n\r\n/* == autohide the stars == */\r\n\r\n#extbook-main-box .extbook-icon,\r\n#extbook-main-box #extbook-addstar {visibility: collapse !important;}\r\n\r\n#star-button {display: none !important;}\r\n\r\n/* == recover by hovering == */\r\n\r\n#urlbar:hover .extbook-icon {visibility: visible !important;}\r\n\r\n#urlbar:hover #star-button {display: -moz-box !important;}\r\n\r\n}"}
