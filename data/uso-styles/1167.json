Depending on whether or not you have Dom Inspector, change the number of each button as required (they start with \"0\").  My example below is what I use; if you only have 3-4 buttons then play with changing the # at the end of each button to \"1,\" \"2,\" or \"3\" and eliminating/adding as necessary (you may only need #custombuttons-button1 {background: yellow!important} \r\nfor example)  I use it to differentiate Multi search buttons based on a great multi-image search button developed by Lou Cypher/Zoolcar9 available here:\r\nhttp://custombuttons.phpbbnow.com/viewtopic.php?t=333","user":{"id":15,"name":"Paulfox","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2006-10-21T01:41:18.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":484,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/1167_after.png?r=1579680068","url":"/styles/1167/custombuttons-background-color-specific","discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2,"css":"/*Coded by Paulfox Oct 21st, 2006 1:41AM Ver 1.0*/\r\n@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n#custombuttons-button5, #custombuttons-button6,  #custombuttons-button7 {background: yellow!important}"}
