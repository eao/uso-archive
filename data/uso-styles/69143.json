I am Shinn, a young hardcore gamer looking for the best games out there in the wide world of video games.\r\n\r\nI am a very creative and well qualified for web development, picture editing and audio editing. I tend to be very quiet since I have hard time dealing with my English. I like being with friends and screwing around, trying to keep them entertained.\r\n\r\nI sometimes let myself go a bit too often, but at least I manage to make good friends.\r\n\r\nAnything else you want to know ?
