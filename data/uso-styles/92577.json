Allows you to see all five phone numbers at once when texting several people. (I may eventually add a userscript to show contact names instead of just numbers.) Also removes rounded corners on the popup (because the background images used for rounded corners weren't wide enough).","user":{"id":209437,"name":"bengott","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbysa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2013-11-05T10:05:03.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":210,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/92577_after.png?r=1589702632","url":"/styles/92577/google-voice-roomy-send-text-message-box","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://www.google.com/voice\") {\r\ninput.gc-text {\r\n  width: 500px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.gc-quicksms textarea {\r\n  width: 500px !important;\r\n  height: 100px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.gc-bubble-content {\r\n  border: 1px solid lightgray !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.gc-bgimg {\r\n  background: white !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.gc-bubble-callout {\r\n  background: url('https://www.google.com/voice/resources/1888257991-bubble-callout.png') no-repeat !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}
