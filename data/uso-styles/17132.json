Instead they tell you, you *would* have found it here if you paid? Never again. Ads gone, solution shown :-)\r\n\r\nAnd as for the comment of Scriptuser below: I recommend to try it on more than one page before rating it 0. I use it in exactly that combination (Firefox 3 on Windows XP), and it works fine. Admitted, in some rare cases it fails (one out of 20 - meaning I didn't visit more than 20 pages yet, but it failed only once). If you encounter such a case, instead of rating 0 rather let me know so I can possibly do some thing about it.","user":{"id":12769,"name":"Izzy","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2012-08-24T06:50:12.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":777,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/17132_after.jpeg?r=1587715404","url":"/styles/17132/expertsexchange","discussionsCount":6,"commentsCount":23,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.experts-exchange.com\"), domain(\"llnw.experts-exchange.com\") {\r\n  /* .ms .bl, .ms .bc { visibility: visible !important; display: block !important; } */\r\n  /* hide ads */\r\n  #pageMain > .sectionFour, .adSense, .relatedSolutionsContainer { display: none !important; }\r\n  /* hide \"free trial\" blabla */\r\n  /* .bcQuestion > .answers, .startFreeTrial, #pageRight, .blurredAnswer, */\r\n  .viewQuestionAnswerOverlay,\r\n  .trailing-meta, .bffr_trusted,\r\n  .viewQuestionBuffer { display: none !important; }\r\n}"}
