{"id":4229,"name":"Remember The Milk - Tag Cloud Line Spacing","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"rememberthemilk","subcategory":"rememberthemilk","style_tags":[],"description":"Based on this excellent idea found in RTM's forum:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rememberthemilk.com/forums/tips/2943/\r\n\r\nI've been using my task cloud as a nicely formatted way to get to what normally I would need a smartlist for.  Clicking on a tag creates an automatic smartlist of sorts.  It's only a one-dimensional smartlist that looks for the given tag, but having your cloud formatted in such a way makes creating things like on-the-fly context lists easy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this is all a hack and so you can't introduce spacing to help seperate the various sections out.  So in order to make things a bit more readable, I've created this small script which increases the line-spacing for all the lines within the cloud.","user":{"id":4743,"name":"dvdmon","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"levi@dvdmon.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2007-11-23T09:45:41.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1080,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/4229-after.png?r=1589875710","url":"/styles/4229/remember-the-milk-tag-cloud-line-spacing","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(https://www.rememberthemilk.com/),url-prefix(http://www.rememberthemilk.com/) {\r\n.taskcloudcontent {line-height: 40px !important; }\r\n}"}
