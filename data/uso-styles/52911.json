(Firefox 4, Firefox 5 & Firefox 6 tested)\r\nI think thats a better styling for small screens, e.g. on netbooks and notebooks. Have fun!\r\n\r\nATTENTION: Resize windows after activation! So the tab bar will be resized and you will profit of the smaller size with more overview.","user":{"id":115388,"name":"Balthazzar","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2011-08-26T06:26:18.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1145,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/52911_after.png?r=1588579488","url":"/styles/52911/firefox-4-smaller-menu-button-with-icon","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"#appmenu-button {\r\n    min-width:   40px !important;\r\n    max-width:   40px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#appmenu-button .button-text {\r\n    display:     none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#appmenu-button .button-icon {\r\n    margin-left:      -14px;\r\n    margin-top:       2px;\r\n    list-style-image: url(\"chrome://branding/content/icon16.png\");\r\n}"}
