I liked the dark image background on Firefox when viewing images like jpg, gif, & png directly, so I created a style for it to use in Chrome and other browsers. Anytime you view images directly in the web browser, where you see it ending in the image extension like http://i.imgur.com/6sJvBjx.jpg , a file from your computer, or whatever, you'll have a dark background instead of a blinding white one.","user":{"id":202976,"name":"ekliptical","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"keitherwin@gmail.com","homepage":"http://diyvapormods.com","about":null,"license":"ccby"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2016-03-12T04:58:46.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":375,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/91955_after.jpeg?r=1588061121","url":"/styles/91955/dark-image-background","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document regexp(\"http://.*\\\\.jpg\"), regexp(\"https://.*\\\\.jpg\"), regexp(\"http://.*\\\\.png\"), regexp(\"https://.*\\\\.png\"), regexp(\"http://.*\\\\.gif\"), regexp(\"https://.*\\\\.gif\"), regexp(\"http://.*\\\\.jpeg\"), regexp(\"https://.*\\\\.jpeg\"), regexp(\"https://.*\\\\.webp\"), regexp(\"https://www.google.com\") {\r\nbody\r\n{\r\nbackground-color:050505;\r\n}\r\n}"}
