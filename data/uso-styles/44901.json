Because of my small screen it forces me to scroll down if I want to see the related videos. For that reason I wrote some simple custom css styles to hide them. They'll be loaded anyway but you won't see them anymore. So, don't worry: Google will get the money for your view as well ;-)\r\n\r\nNote: The video ads and the ads inside the player can't be hidden by CSS!","user":{"id":92181,"name":"the_Ben","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2011-03-06T10:22:19.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":5421,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/44901_after.jpeg?r=1597305985","url":"/styles/44901/youtube-remove-ads","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"youtube.com\") {\r\n\r\n#instream_google_companion_ad_div {\r\ndisplay: none; \r\nvisibility: hidden;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiv#watch-sidebar {\r\nmargin-top: -449px !important;\r\n}\r\ndiv#ad_creative_1, div#ad_creative_2, div#ad_creative_3 {\r\ndisplay:none !important;\r\nvisibility:hidden !important;\r\n}\r\ndiv#watch-channel-brand-div {\r\ndisplay:none !important;\r\nvisibility:hidden !important;\r\n}\r\n#watch-longform-ad {\r\ndisplay:none !important;\r\nvisibility:hidden !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}
