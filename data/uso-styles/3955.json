I'm working on delineating the individual buttons but it's seemingly rather difficult and I won't have any more time tonight.  Rather a pain, and I've been on it 3 hours already.\r\n\r\nMy former script here\r\nhttp://userstyles.org/styles/291\r\n\r\nwas very popular, but it's not working as of 10/29/07 due to a site change.  GOOD News . . . GMail is much improved, bigger mailbox size, and larger contact photos and contact list controls.  Very cool!","user":{"id":15,"name":"Paulfox","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2007-10-29T23:44:28.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1098,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/3955_after.gif?r=1589789100","url":"/styles/3955/gmail-new-format-button-colors","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/*Coded by Paulfox October 29th, 2007, Version 3.2 as successor to my GMail Button Colors Script (site change @ Gmail)*/\r\n/*Original Script Coded by Paulfox April 20th 2006*/\r\n@-moz-document domain(mail.google.com) { \r\nBUTTON {color:black!important; font-weight:bold!important; background:lightgreen!important}}\r\n"}
