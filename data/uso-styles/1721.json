I don't know if I'll use it because it takes all of the personality out of the forums.\r\n\r\nIt removes the forum logo and (in case you don't have AdBlock) the Google ads and the Paypal logo from IPB forums (look at the bottom of the home page to see if you are on an IPB forum).\r\n\r\nTo use it change the first \"domain\" (\"forums.invisionpower.com\") to your forum's domain.  Add other domains with \"domain(\"domain_name\"),\".  You must have a comma between domain names but not after the last one.  That's why I put two redundant domains in the style.","user":{"id":202,"name":"Webb","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2007-01-27T18:04:04.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1850,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/1721_after.gif?r=1588233931","url":"/styles/1721/ipb-forums-cleaner","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":2,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"forums.invisionpower.com\"),\r\ndomain(\"forums.invisionpower.com\"){\r\n#logostrip,#google_ad,#navstrip+FORM,IFRAME\r\n{display:none !important;}\r\n#ipbwrapper{margin-top:0px !important;}}"}
