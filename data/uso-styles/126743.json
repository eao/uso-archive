Perhaps you'd like to see them on Voat as well, right?

Just keep in note that this does not userstyle doesn't work everywhere, and some subverses that have their own custom voting arrows might not allow this userstlye to work.\r\n\r\nThis also changes the color of (+|-) to look like the one from reddit, just like another userstyle I made.
