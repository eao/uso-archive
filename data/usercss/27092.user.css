@name           Treasure Madness: Highlight Complete Collections

@description    `This user style is for the Treasure Madness game on Facebook.I have a lot of incomplete collections, and to find the ones that were complete and ready to be secured with the museum, I got really tired of either keeping them all expanded and scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, or keeping them collapsed and guessing at which one it was.So I whipped up a user style which would allow me to keep them all collapsed, but still able to see the "secure" button, which makes for much faster scanning of my treasures page.Links to larger screenshots:Before: http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/7964/27092before.pngAfter: http://img683.imageshack.us/img683/908/27092after.png`
