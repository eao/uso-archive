@description    `I made this style to go along with style 24339I would have included this in the Reddit Redux style but it looked odd with some of the greasemonkey scripts that modify Reddit's comment section. I figured it would be better to separate it and give people the option of adding the style to the comments separately.Full resolution before/after here:http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/9528/commentsnewvold.jpgSpecifics:- background/border for each individual comment- mouseover action on the upmod/downmod arrows- rounded bordersSee style 24339 for a full list of features of the Reddit Redux style.`
