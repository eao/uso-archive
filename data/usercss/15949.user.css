@name           Facebook - Always Show Hidden Filters

@description    `In the newest Facebook layout - this does 3 small simple things I found useful:1. Makes the hidden filters in the filter list always visible2. Hides the "More >" link under those which is now obsolete3. Hides the instructions to drag & drop which are obvious to most of us and if not, they really don't need to be displayed all the time`
