@description    `INFORMATION!-- November 18, 2020: today momio replaced the emojis with even uglier ones, which is why this replacement no longer worked. now it works again! --momio's emojis don't look really nice because of the black color and small details. With this theme, the emojis are replaced with normal colored and recognizable emojis.`
