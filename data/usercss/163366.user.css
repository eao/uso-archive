@description    `In mid-2017 my timeline finally started including tweets that other people "liked". Not retweeted, just clicked "like".At times it was a third of my feed or more. Since LIKES ARE NOT SHARES (cc Facebook), this style hides them.Updated by @zlapper, initial version by @mildmojo, released under CC0.`
