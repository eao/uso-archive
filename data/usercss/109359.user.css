@name           Lifehacker, Gizmodo: Enlarge Story Titles
@namespace      USO Archive
@author         Nauman Afzal
@description    `Ever since the latest design of Gawker has been launched. I didn't like the small text size of normal story titles. Not so easy on eyes when you quickly scrolling through. So, I have enlarged it a bit. You can more Gawker websites to the script. I have added two since I just use those.`
