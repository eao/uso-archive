@description    `Simple rework to work with the 18.4 forum change.To make it work, first change the official forum theme to dark theme, then enable the style.Can also work together with my old style, it's a minor change if you enable both. Tweak as you wish.I doubt I will do any more tweaking to this (other than fixing what DE breaks), it looks good enough for me. Feel free to edit as long as you give credit.`
